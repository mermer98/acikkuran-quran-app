98,2,91,"When it is said to them, ""Believe in what Allah has revealed,"" they say, “We believe in what has been revealed to us” - and they deny what is beyond it, whereas that is the truth which confirms what is with them.

711,5,42,"They are listeners to the fallacy, devourers of the unlawful. So, if they come to you, judge between them or turn away from them. If you turn away from them, they can do you no harm. But if you judge, judge between them with justice. Surely, Allah loves those who do justice.",Taqi Usmani
712,5,43,"How do they ask you to judge while the Torah is with them, having the ruling of Allah? Still, they turn away, after all that. They are no believers.",Taqi Usmani
713,5,44,"Surely We have sent down the Torah, in which there was guidance and light by which the prophets, who submitted themselves to Allah, used to judge for the Jews, and (so did) the Men of Allah and the Men of knowledge, because they were ordained to protect the Book of Allah, and they stood guard over it. So, (O Jews of today,) do not fear people. Fear Me, and do not take a paltry price for My verses. Those who do not judge according to what Allah has sent down are the disbelievers.",Taqi Usmani
714,5,45,"We prescribed for them therein: A life for a life, an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for an ear and a tooth for a tooth; and for wounds, an equal retaliation. Then, if one forgives it, that will be expiation for him. Those who do not judge according to what Allah has sent down, they are the unjust.",Taqi Usmani
715,5,46,"We sent ‘Īsā son of Maryam after those prophets, confirming the Torah that was (revealed) before him, and We gave him the Injīl having guidance and light therein, and confirming the Torah that was (revealed) before it; a guidance and a lesson for the God-fearing.",Taqi Usmani

So, judge between them according to what Allah has sent down, and do not follow their desires against the truth that has come to you. For each of you We have made a law and a method. Had Allah willed, He would have made a single community of people, but (He did not), so that He may test you in what He has given to you. Strive, then, to excel each other in good deeds. To Allah is the return for all of you. Then Allah shall tell you about that in which you disputed.",Taqi Usmani
718,5,49,"We order you to judge between them according to what Allah has sent down. Do not follow their desires, and beware of them, lest they should turn you away from some of what Allah has sent down to you. If they turn away, be assured that Allah intends to make them suffer for some of their sins. Surely, many of the people are sinners.",Taqi Usmani

720,5,51,"O you who believe, do not take the Jews and the Christians for intimate friends. They are friends to each other. Whoever takes them as intimate friends is one of them. Surely, Allah does not take the unjust people to the right path.",Taqi Usmani
721,5,52,"Now, you see those who have disease in their hearts race towards them saying, ""We apprehend that some misfortune may overtake us.""So, it is likely that Allah may bring victory or something else from His own side, whereupon they will become regretful over what they concealed in their hearts.",Taqi Usmani
722,5,53,"Those who believe will say, ""Are these the ones who swore their solemn oaths by Allah that they were with you?"" Their deeds have gone to waste, and they became losers.",Taqi Usmani

733,5,64,"The Jews said, ""Allah’s hand is fettered."" Fettered are their own hands, and cursed are they for what they said. In fact, His hands are outspread. He spends as He wills. What has been sent down to you from your Lord shall certainly increase many of them in rebellion and disbelief. We have put enmity and hatred amongst them lasting to the Day of Doom.

741,5,72,"Surely, disbelievers are those who say, ""Allah is the MasīH, son of Maryam"" while the MasīH had said, “O children of Isrā’īl , worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.” In fact, whoever ascribes any partner to Allah, Allah has prohibited for him the Jannah (the Paradise), and his shelter is the Fire, and there will be no supporters for the unjust.",Taqi Usmani

764,5,95,"O you who believe, do not kill game when you are in IHrām (state of consecration for Hajj or ‘Umrah). If someone from among you kills it deliberately, then compensation (will be required) from cattle equal to what one has killed, according to the judgement of two just men from among you, as an offering due to reach the Ka’bah, or an expiation, that is, to feed the poor, or its equal in fasts, so that he may taste the punishment of what he did.

3259,28,7,"We inspired the mother of Mūsā saying, ""Suckle him (Mūsā). Then once you fear about him, cast him in the river, and do not fear, and do not grieve. Surely We are going to bring him back to you and appoint him one of (Our) messengers.""",Taqi Usmani
3260,28,8,"So the family of Pharaoh picked him up, so that he becomes for them an enemy and a (cause of) grief. Indeed Pharaoh, Hāmān and their armies were mistaken.",Taqi Usmani
3261,28,9,"And the wife of Pharaoh said, (to Pharaoh about Mūsā), ""He may be a delight of eye for me and you. Do not kill him. It is hoped that he will be of benefit to us, or we will adopt him as a son."" And they were not aware (of what was going to happen).",Taqi Usmani
3262,28,10,"And the heart of the mother of Mūsā became restless; indeed she was about to disclose this (the real facts about Mūsā), had We not strengthened her heart to remain among those who have firm belief (in Allah’s promise).",Taqi Usmani
3263,28,11,"She said to his sister, ""Keep track of him."" So she watched him from a distance, while they were not aware.",Taqi Usmani
3264,28,12,"And We had already barred him (Mūsā) from (accepting) any suckling women, so she (his sister) said (to Pharaoh’s people), ""Shall I point out to you a family who will nurse him for you, and they will be his well-wishers?""",Taqi Usmani
3265,28,13,"Thus We brought him back to his mother, so that her eye might have comfort and she might not grieve, and so that she might know that Allah’s promise is true, but most of them do not know.",Taqi Usmani

So the one from his own group called him for help against the one who was from his enemies. So Mūsā gave him a blow with his fist and finished him off. (Then) He (Mūsā) said (out of remorse), ""This is some of Satan’s act. He is indeed a clear enemy who misleads (people).""",Taqi Usmani

3270,28,18,"Then next morning he was fearful in the city, waiting (for what comes next) when the man who sought his help the day before, shouted to him for help (again). Mūsā said to him, ""You are surely a clear trouble-maker.""",Taqi Usmani
3271,28,19,"Thereafter when he intended to grasp at the one who was an enemy to both of them, he (i.e. the Israelite) said, ""O Mūsā, do you want to kill me as you have killed a person yesterday? Your intention is only to become a tyrant in the land, and you do not intend to be one of the peace-makers.""",Taqi Usmani
3272,28,20,"And there came a man running from the farthest part of the city. He said, ""The chiefs are counseling each other about you, so that they kill you. So, leave (the city). I am one of your well-wishers.""",Taqi Usmani

3277,28,25,"Then one of the two women came to him, walking bashfully. She said, ""My father is calling you, so that he may give you a reward for watering our animals.

3278,28,26,"One of the two women said, ""Dear father, hire him; the best man you can hire is someone who is strong, trustworthy.""",Taqi Usmani
3279,28,27,"He (the father) said (to Mūsā), ""I wish to marry to you one of these two daughters of mine on condition that you act as my employee for eight years.

3280,28,28,"He (Mūsā) said, ""This is (done) between me and you. Whichever of the two terms I fulfill, there should be no excess against me, and Allah is witness to what we are saying.""",Taqi Usmani
3281,28,29,"So, when Mūsā completed the term and set forth with his wife, he noticed a fire from the direction of (the mount) Tūr, he said to his wife, ""Stay here; I have noticed a fire. May be I bring to you some information or an ember from the fire, so that you may warm yourself.""",Taqi Usmani
3282,28,30,"So when he came to it, he was called by a voice coming from a side of the right valley in the blessed ground, from the tree, saying, ""O Mūsā, I AM ALLAH, the Lord of the worlds,""",Taqi Usmani
3283,28,31,"and saying, ""Throw down your staff."" So when he saw it moving as if it were a snake, he turned back in retreat, and did not look back. (Allah said to him), “O Mūsā come forward and do not fear; you are one of those in peace.",Taqi Usmani
3284,28,32,"Insert your hand into your bosom, and it will come out white without any evil (disease), and press your arm to your side for (removing) fear. Thus these are two proofs from your Lord (sent) to Pharaoh and his chiefs. Indeed they are transgressing people.""",Taqi Usmani
3285,28,33,"He said, ""My Lord, I have killed a person from them, therefore I fear that they will kill me.",Taqi Usmani

3287,28,35,"He (Allah) said, ""We will strengthen your arm with your brother, and will give both of you such a power that they will have no access to you (to cause any harm) because of Our signs. You and your followers will be the victors.""",Taqi Usmani
3288,28,36,"So when Mūsā came to them with Our clear signs, they said, ""This is nothing but a forged magic, and we have never heard of such a thing happening in the days of our forefathers.""",Taqi Usmani
3289,28,37,"Mūsā said, ""My Lord is best aware of the one who has brought guidance from Him and who is going to meet the best end of the abode. It is certain that the wrongdoers will not succeed.""",Taqi Usmani
3290,28,38,"And Pharaoh said (to his people,) ""O courtiers, I do not recognize any god for you other than me. So kindle for me, O Hāmān, a fire on the clay (to bake bricks) and build for me a tower, so that I may look on to the God of Mūsā. I deem him to be one of the liars.""",Taqi Usmani
3291,28,39,(Thus) he and his hosts showed arrogance in the land with no justification and thought that they would not be returned to Us.,Taqi Usmani

3293,28,41,"We made them leaders who called (people) towards hell; and on the Day of Judgment, they will not be helped.",Taqi Usmani

3296,28,44,"And (O prophet,) you were not there at the Western side (of the mount Tūr) when We delegated the matter to Mūsā, nor were you among those present,",Taqi Usmani
3297,28,45,"but We created generations (after him) and a long time passed over them. And you were not dwelling among the people of Madyan, reciting Our verses to them, but it is We who do send messengers.",Taqi Usmani
3298,28,46,"And you were not at the side of (the mount) Tūr when We called (Mūsā), but it (your prophet-hood through which you knew all this) is a mercy from your Lord, so that you warn a people to whom no warner has come before you, that they may receive the advice.",Taqi Usmani
3299,28,47,"And (We have sent you as a messenger) lest, in case they suffered a calamity because of what their hands sent ahead, they should say, ""Our Lord, why did You not send a messenger to us, so that we might have followed your verses and been among the believers?""",Taqi Usmani
3300,28,48,"But when the Truth came to them from Us, they said, ""Why has he (the messenger) not been given (a book) similar to what Mūsā had been given?"" Is it not that they denied what Mūsā had been given before?

3301,28,49,"Say, ""Then bring a book from Allah which is better than both, in guidance, and I shall follow it, if you are true.""",Taqi Usmani

6065,92,7,We will facilitate for him the way to extreme ease (i.e. the comforts of Paradise).,Taqi Usmani
6066,92,8,"But the one who is miser and deems himself self-sufficient,",Taqi Usmani
6067,92,9,"and rejects the best (religion),",Taqi Usmani
6068,92,10,We will facilitate for him the way to extreme distress.,Taqi Usmani

6118,96,12,"or bids piety, (would the former still forbid him?)",Taqi Usmani
6119,96,13,"Tell me, if he rejects (the true faith) and turns away,",Taqi Usmani
6120,96,14,does he not know that Allah is watching (him)?,Taqi Usmani
6121,96,15,"No! If he does not desist, We will certainly drag (him) by forelock,",Taqi Usmani
6122,96,16,"a lying, sinful forelock.",Taqi Usmani
6123,96,17,"So let him call the men of his council,",Taqi Usmani
6124,96,18,We will call the soldiers of the Hell.,Taqi Usmani
6125,96,19,"No! Never obey him, and bow down in sajdah, and come close to Me.",Taqi Usmani

6136,98,6,"Surely those who disbelieved from among the People of the Book and the polytheists will be in the fire of Jahannam , in which they will be living forever. Those are the worst of all human beings.",Taqi Usmani

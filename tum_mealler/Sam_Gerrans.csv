1654,12,58,"And the brothers of Joseph came, and entered upon him; and he knew them, but he was to them unknown.",Sam Gerrans
1655,12,59,"And when he had furnished them with their provisions, he said: “Bring me a brother of yours from your father; see you not that I give full measure, and that I am the best of hosts?",Sam Gerrans
1656,12,60,"“But if you bring him not to me, then no measure will there be for you with me, nor will you approach me.”",Sam Gerrans
1657,12,61,They said: “We will seek to lure him away from his father — and that will we do.”,Sam Gerrans
1658,12,62,"And he said to his servants: “Put their merchandise in their saddlebags, that they might recognise it when they return to their people, that they might return.”",Sam Gerrans
1659,12,63,"And when they returned to their father, they said: “O our father: forbidden us was the measure, so send thou with us our brother; we will obtain the measure; and we will keep him safe.”",Sam Gerrans
1660,12,64,"He said: “Am I to trust him to you save as I trusted his brother to you before? And God is the best custodian, and He is the most merciful of those who show mercy.”",Sam Gerrans
1661,12,65,"And when they opened their possessions, they found their merchandise returned to them. They said: “O our father: what more can we ask! This is our merchandise returned to us. And we will get provision for our people and guard our brother, and will have increase of a camel’s measure — that is an easy measure.”",Sam Gerrans
1662,12,66,"He said: “I will not send him with you until you give me a solemn oath before God that you will bring him to me save that you be surrounded.” And when they had brought him their solemn oath, he said: “God is guardian over what we say.”",Sam Gerrans
1663,12,67,"And he said: “O my sons: enter not by one gate, but enter by different gates. But I cannot avail you anything against God. Judgment is but for God; in Him have I placed my trust. And in Him let trust those who would place their trust aright.”",Sam Gerrans
1664,12,68,"And when they entered in what manner their father had commanded them, it availed them nothing against God; it was but a need in the soul of Jacob which he satisfied. And he was a man of knowledge due to what We had taught him; but most men know not.",Sam Gerrans
1665,12,69,"And when they entered upon Joseph, he took his brother to himself; he said: “I am thy brother, so despair thou not at what they did.”",Sam Gerrans
1666,12,70,"And when he had furnished them with their provisions, he put the drinking-cup into the saddlebag of his brother. Then a crier cried: “O you of the caravan: you are thieves!”",Sam Gerrans
1667,12,71,"Said they, approaching them: “What is it you are missing?”",Sam Gerrans
1668,12,72,They said: “We do miss the King’s goblet; and for him who brings it is a camel-load; and I guarantee it.”,Sam Gerrans
1669,12,73,"Said they: “By God, you know we came not to work corruption in the land! And we are not thieves.”",Sam Gerrans
1670,12,74,"They said: “And what is the recompense for it, if you are liars?”",Sam Gerrans
1671,12,75,"Said they: “The recompense for it is that he in whose saddlebag it is found, he is the recompense for it. Thus requite we the wrongdoers.”",Sam Gerrans
1672,12,76,So he began with their bags before the bag of his brother; then he brought it forth from the bag of his brother. (Thus did We plan for Joseph; he could not have taken his brother within the doctrine of the King save that God had so willed. We raise in degree whom We will; and over every possessor of knowledge is One knowing.),Sam Gerrans
1673,12,77,"Said they: “If he steals, then there stole a brother of his before.” (But Joseph concealed it within his soul, and did not reveal it to them, saying: “You are in worse position; and God best knows what you describe.”)",Sam Gerrans
1674,12,78,"Said they: “O Governor: he has a father, old and great, so take thou one of us in his place; we see thou art among the doers of good.”",Sam Gerrans

1676,12,80,"And when they had despaired of him, they separated themselves for private conference. The eldest of them said: “Know you not that your father took a solemn oath from you before God — and you failed concerning Joseph before? And I will not leave the land until my father gives me leave, or God judges in my favour; and He is the best of judges.",Sam Gerrans

1680,12,84,And he turned away from them and said: “O my grief for Joseph!” And his eyes became white from the sorrow he was suppressing.,Sam Gerrans
1681,12,85,"They said: “By God, thou wilt never cease remembering Joseph until thou art decrepit, or art of those who perish!”",Sam Gerrans
1682,12,86,He said: “I but complain of my distress and grief to God; but I know from God what you know not.,Sam Gerrans
1683,12,87,"“O my sons: go and ask about Joseph and his brother, and despair not of the comfort of God; none despairs of the comfort of God save the unbelieving people.”",Sam Gerrans
1684,12,88,"And when they entered upon him, they said: “O Governor: affliction has touched us and our people, and we have come with paltry merchandise. Fulfil thou for us the measure, and be thou charitable to us; God rewards the charitable.”",Sam Gerrans
1685,12,89,"He said: “Know you what you did to Joseph and his brother, when you were ignorant?”",Sam Gerrans
1686,12,90,"They said: “Is it indeed thou, Joseph?” He said: “I am Joseph, and this is my brother. God has favoured us. Whoso is in prudent fear and is patient — God causes not to be lost the reward of the doers of good.”",Sam Gerrans
1687,12,91,"They said: “By God, indeed God has preferred thee over us and we were of the offenders!”",Sam Gerrans
1688,12,92,He said: “No blame is upon you this day. God will forgive you; and He is the most merciful of those who show mercy.,Sam Gerrans
1689,12,93,"“Go with this my shirt, and cast it upon the face of my father — he will come to see — and come to me with your household all together.”",Sam Gerrans
1690,12,94,"And when the caravan departed, their father said: “I perceive the scent of Joseph–– had you not thought me weak in mind.”",Sam Gerrans
1691,12,95,"They said: “By God, thou art in thine old error!”",Sam Gerrans
1692,12,96,"Then when the bearer of glad tidings came he cast it upon his face, and he could see again. He said: “Said I not to you that I know from God what you know not?”",Sam Gerrans
1693,12,97,They said: “O our father: ask thou forgiveness for us for our transgressions; we were of the offenders.”,Sam Gerrans
1694,12,98,"He said: “I will ask forgiveness for you of my Lord; He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.”",Sam Gerrans
1695,12,99,"And when they entered upon Joseph, he took his parents to himself, and said: “Enter Egypt, if God wills, in safety.”",Sam Gerrans
1696,12,100,"And he raised his parents upon the throne. And they fell down to him in submission, and he said: “O my father: this is the fulfilment of my dream before. My Lord has made it true. And He did good to me when He took me out of the prison, and brought you from the desert after the satan had provoked to evil between me and my brothers. My Lord is subtle in what He wills; He is the Knowing, the Wise.”",Sam Gerrans
1697,12,101,"“My Lord: Thou hast given me some dominion, and hast taught me some of the interpretation of events; Creator of the Heavens and the Earth: Thou art my ally in the World and the Hereafter. Take Thou me as one submitting, and join Thou me with the righteous.”",Sam Gerrans

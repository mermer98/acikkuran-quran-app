4228,41,10,"He placed on it stabilizers (mountains), made it productive, and He calculated its provisions in four days, to satisfy the needs of all its inhabitants.*",Rashad Khalifa
4229,41,11,"Then He turned to the sky, when it was still gas, and said to it, and to the earth, ""Come into existence, willingly or unwillingly."" They said, ""We come willingly.""",Rashad Khalifa
4230,41,12,"Thus, He completed the seven universes in two days, and set up the laws for every universe. And we adorned the lowest universe with lamps, and placed guards around it. Such is the design of the Almighty, the Omniscient.,",Rashad Khalifa
4231,41,13,"If they turn away, then say, ""I am warning you of a disaster like the disaster that annihilated 'Aad and Thamoud.""",Rashad Khalifa

4233,41,15,"As for 'Aad, they turned arrogant on earth, opposed the truth, and said, ""Who is more powerful than we?"" Did they not realize that GOD, who created them, is more powerful than they? They were unappreciative of our revelations.",Rashad Khalifa
4234,41,16,"Consequently, we sent upon them violent wind, for a few miserable days. We thus afflicted them with humiliating retribution in this life, and the retribution of the Hereafter is more humiliating; they can never win.",Rashad Khalifa
4235,41,17,"As for Thamoud, we provided them with guidance, but they preferred blindness over guidance. Consequently, the disastrous and shameful retribution annihilated them, because of what they earned.",Rashad Khalifa

4241,41,23,"This kind of thinking about your Lord will cause you to fall, and then you become losers.",Rashad Khalifa
4242,41,24,"If they continue the way they are, Hell will be their destiny, and if they make up excuses, they will not be excused.",Rashad Khalifa
4243,41,25,"We assign to them companions who adorn everything they do in their eyes. Thus, they end up incurring the same fate as the previous communities of jinns and humans, who were also losers.",Rashad Khalifa
4244,41,26,"Those who disbelieved said, ""Do not listen to this Quran and distort it, that you may win.""",Rashad Khalifa
4245,41,27,We will certainly afflict these disbelievers with a severe retribution. We will certainly requite them for their evil works.,Rashad Khalifa
4246,41,28,Such is the requital that awaits GOD's enemies. Hell will be their eternal abode; a just requital for discarding our revelations.,Rashad Khalifa

4258,41,40,"Surely, those who distort our revelations are not hidden from us. Is one who gets thrown into Hell better, or one who comes secure on the Day of Resurrection? Do whatever you wish; He is Seer of everything you do.",Rashad Khalifa

4261,41,43,"What is said to you is precisely what was said to the previous messengers. Your Lord possesses forgiveness, and He also possesses painful retribution.",Rashad Khalifa
4262,41,44,"If we made it a non-Arabic Quran they would have said, ""Why did it come down in that language?"" Whether it is Arabic or non-Arabic, say, ""For those who believe, it is a guide and healing. As for those who disbelieve, they will be deaf and blind to it, as if they are being addressed from faraway.""",Rashad Khalifa
4263,41,45,"We have given Moses the scripture and it was also disputed. If it were not for your Lord's predetermined decision, they would have been judged immediately. Indeed, they harbor too many doubts.",Rashad Khalifa

4265,41,47,"With Him is the knowledge about the Hour (end of the world). No fruits emerge from their sheaths, nor does any female conceive or give birth, without His knowledge. The day will come when He asks them: ""Where are those idols that you set up beside Me?"" They will say, ""We proclaim to You that none of us bears witness to that.""",Rashad Khalifa
4266,41,48,"The idols they had idolized will disown them, and they will realize that there will be no escape.",Rashad Khalifa
4267,41,49,"The human being never tires of imploring for good things. And when adversity befalls him, he turns despondent, desperate.",Rashad Khalifa

Even if I am returned to my Lord, I will find at Him better things."" Most certainly, we will inform the disbelievers of all their works, and will commit them to severe retribution.",Rashad Khalifa

4278,42,6,"Those who set up other lords beside Him, GOD is the One in charge of them; you are not their advocate.",Rashad Khalifa
4279,42,7,"We thus reveal to you an Arabic Quran to warn the central community and all around it, and to warn about the Day of Summoning that is inevitable. Some will end up in Heaven, and some in Hell.",Rashad Khalifa

4286,42,14,"Ironically, they broke up into sects only after the knowledge had come to them, due to jealousy and resentment among themselves.

4290,42,18,"Challenging it are those who do not believe in it. As for those who believe, they are concerned about it, and they know that it is the truth. Absolutely, those who deny the Hour have gone far astray.",Rashad Khalifa

4293,42,21,"They follow idols who decree for them religious laws never authorized by GOD. If it were not for the predetermined decision, they would have been judged immediately. Indeed, the transgressors have incurred a painful retribution.",Rashad Khalifa
4294,42,22,"You will see the transgressors worried about everything they had committed; everything will come back and haunt them. As for those who believed and led a righteous life, they will be in the gardens of Paradise. They will receive whatever they wish from their Lord. This is the great blessing.",Rashad Khalifa
4295,42,23,"This is the good news from GOD to His servants who believe and lead a righteous life. Say, ""I do not ask you for any wage. I do ask each of you to take care of your own relatives."" Anyone who does a righteous work, we multiply his reward for it. GOD is Forgiver, Appreciative.",Rashad Khalifa

4311,42,39,"When gross injustice befalls them, they stand up for their rights.",Rashad Khalifa
4312,42,40,"Although the just requital for an injustice is an equivalent retribution, those who pardon and maintain righteousness are rewarded by GOD. He does not love the unjust.",Rashad Khalifa
4313,42,41,"Certainly, those who stand up for their rights, when injustice befalls them, are not committing any error.",Rashad Khalifa
4314,42,42,"The wrong ones are those who treat the people unjustly, and resort to aggression without provocation. These have incurred a painful retribution.",Rashad Khalifa

4317,42,45,"You will see them facing it, humiliated and debased, and looking, yet trying to avoid looking.

4320,42,48,"If they turn away, we did not send you as their guardian. Your sole mission is delivering the message.

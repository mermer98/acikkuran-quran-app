366,3,73,"And only believe those who follow your religion."" Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ ""Surely, ˹the only˺ true guidance is Allah’s guidance.” ˹They also said,˺ “Do not believe that someone will receive ˹revealed˺ knowledge similar to yours or argue against you before your Lord.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Indeed, all bounty is in the Hands of Allah—He grants it to whoever He wills. And Allah is All-Bountiful, All-Knowing.”",Mustafa Khattab
367,3,74,He chooses whoever He wills to receive His mercy. And Allah is the Lord of infinite bounty.,Mustafa Khattab
368,3,75,"There are some among the People of the Book who, if entrusted with a stack of gold, will readily return it. Yet there are others who, if entrusted with a single coin, will not repay it unless you constantly demand it. This is because they say, ""We are not accountable for ˹exploiting˺ the Gentiles.""[1] And ˹so˺ they attribute lies to Allah knowingly.",Mustafa Khattab
369,3,76,Absolutely! Those who honour their trusts and shun evil—surely Allah loves those who are mindful ˹of Him˺.,Mustafa Khattab
370,3,77,"Indeed, those who trade Allah’s covenant and their oaths for a fleeting gain will have no share in the Hereafter. Allah will neither speak to them, nor look at them, nor purify them on the Day of Judgment. And they will suffer a painful punishment.",Mustafa Khattab
371,3,78,"There are some among them who distort the Book with their tongues to make you think this ˹distortion˺ is from the Book—but it is not what the Book says. They say, ""It is from Allah""—but it is not from Allah. And ˹so˺ they attribute lies to Allah knowingly.",Mustafa Khattab
372,3,79,"It is not appropriate for someone who Allah has blessed with the Scripture, wisdom, and prophethood to say to people, ""Worship me instead of Allah."" Rather, he would say, “Be devoted to the worship of your Lord ˹alone˺—by virtue of what you read in the Scripture and what you teach.”",Mustafa Khattab
373,3,80,And he would never ask you to take angels and prophets as lords. Would he ask you to disbelieve after you have submitted?,Mustafa Khattab
374,3,81,"˹Remember˺ when Allah made a covenant with the prophets, ˹saying,˺ ""Now that I have given you the Book and wisdom, if there comes to you a messenger[1] confirming what you have, you must believe in him and support him."" He added, “Do you affirm this covenant and accept this commitment?” They said, “Yes, we do.” Allah said, “Then bear witness, and I too am a Witness.”",Mustafa Khattab
375,3,82,"Whoever turns back after this, they will be the rebellious.",Mustafa Khattab
376,3,83,"Do they desire a way other than Allah’s—knowing that all those in the heavens and the earth submit to His Will, willingly or unwillingly, and to Him they will ˹all˺ be returned?",Mustafa Khattab
377,3,84,"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ ""We believe in Allah and what has been revealed to us and what was revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and his descendants; and what was given to Moses, Jesus, and other prophets from their Lord—we make no distinction between any of them, and to Him we ˹fully˺ submit.""",Mustafa Khattab
378,3,85,"Whoever seeks a way other than Islam,[1] it will never be accepted from them, and in the Hereafter they will be among the losers.",Mustafa Khattab
379,3,86,"How will Allah guide a people who chose to disbelieve after they had believed, acknowledged the Messenger to be true, and received clear proofs? For Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.",Mustafa Khattab
380,3,87,"Their reward is that they will be condemned by Allah, the angels, and all of humanity.",Mustafa Khattab
381,3,88,"They will be in Hell forever. Their punishment will not be lightened, nor will they be delayed ˹from it˺.",Mustafa Khattab
382,3,89,"As for those who repent afterwards and mend their ways, then surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",Mustafa Khattab
383,3,90,"Indeed, those who disbelieve after having believed then increase in disbelief, their repentance will never be accepted.[1] It is they who are astray.",Mustafa Khattab
384,3,91,"Indeed, if each of those who disbelieve then die as disbelievers were to offer a ransom of enough gold to fill the whole world, it would never be accepted from them. It is they who will suffer a painful punishment, and they will have no helpers.",Mustafa Khattab
385,3,92,You will never achieve righteousness until you donate some of what you cherish. And whatever you give is certainly well known to Allah.,Mustafa Khattab
386,3,93,"All food was lawful for the children of Israel, except what Israel[1] made unlawful for himself before the Torah was revealed.[2] Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ ""Bring the Torah and read it, if your claims are true.""",Mustafa Khattab
387,3,94,"Then whoever still fabricates lies about Allah, they will be the ˹true˺ wrongdoers.",Mustafa Khattab
388,3,95,"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ ""Allah has declared the truth. So follow the Way of Abraham, the upright—who was not a polytheist.""",Mustafa Khattab
389,3,96,Surely the first House ˹of worship˺ established for humanity is the one at Bakkah—a blessed sanctuary and a guide for ˹all˺ people.,Mustafa Khattab
390,3,97,"In it are clear signs and the standing-place of Abraham. Whoever enters it should be safe. Pilgrimage to this House is an obligation by Allah upon whoever is able among the people.[1] And whoever disbelieves, then surely Allah is not in need of ˹any of His˺ creation.",Mustafa Khattab
391,3,98,"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ ""O People of the Book! Why do you deny the revelations of Allah, when Allah is a Witness to what you do?""",Mustafa Khattab
392,3,99,"Say, ""O People of the Book! Why do you turn the believers away from the Way of Allah—striving to make it ˹appear˺ crooked, while you are witnesses ˹to its truth˺? And Allah is never unaware of what you do.""",Mustafa Khattab
393,3,100,"O believers! If you were to yield to a group of those who were given the Scripture, they would turn you back from belief to disbelief.",Mustafa Khattab
394,3,101,How can you disbelieve when Allah’s revelations are recited to you and His Messenger is in your midst? Whoever holds firmly to Allah is surely guided to the Straight Path.,Mustafa Khattab
395,3,102,"O believers! Be mindful of Allah in the way He deserves,[1] and do not die except in ˹a state of full˺ submission ˹to Him˺.[2]",Mustafa Khattab
396,3,103,"And hold firmly together to the rope of Allah[1] and do not be divided. Remember Allah’s favour upon you when you were enemies, then He united your hearts, so you—by His grace—became brothers. And you were at the brink of a fiery pit and He saved you from it. This is how Allah makes His revelations clear to you, so that you may be ˹rightly˺ guided.",Mustafa Khattab
397,3,104,"Let there be a group among you who call ˹others˺ to goodness, encourage what is good, and forbid what is evil—it is they who will be successful.",Mustafa Khattab
398,3,105,And do not be like those who split ˹into sects˺ and differed after clear proofs had come to them. It is they who will suffer a tremendous punishment.,Mustafa Khattab

400,3,107,"As for the bright-faced, they will be in Allah’s mercy, where they will remain forever.",Mustafa Khattab
401,3,108,These are Allah’s revelations We recite to you ˹O Prophet˺ in truth. And Allah desires no injustice to ˹His˺ creation.,Mustafa Khattab
402,3,109,To Allah ˹alone˺ belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And to Allah ˹all˺ matters will be returned ˹for judgment˺.,Mustafa Khattab
403,3,110,"You are the best community ever raised for humanity—you encourage good, forbid evil, and believe in Allah. Had the People of the Book believed, it would have been better for them. Some of them are faithful, but most are rebellious.",Mustafa Khattab
404,3,111,"They can never inflict harm on you, except a little annoyance.[1] But if they meet you in battle, they will flee and they will have no helpers.",Mustafa Khattab
405,3,112,"They will be stricken with disgrace wherever they go, unless they are protected by a covenant with Allah or a treaty with the people. They have invited the displeasure of Allah and have been branded with misery for rejecting Allah’s revelations and murdering ˹His˺ prophets unjustly. This is ˹a fair reward˺ for their disobedience and violations.",Mustafa Khattab
406,3,113,"Yet they are not all alike: there are some among the People of the Book who are upright, who recite Allah’s revelations throughout the night, prostrating ˹in prayer˺.",Mustafa Khattab
407,3,114,"They believe in Allah and the Last Day, encourage good and forbid evil, and race with one another in doing good. They are ˹truly˺ among the righteous.",Mustafa Khattab
408,3,115,They will never be denied the reward for any good they have done. And Allah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of those mindful ˹of Him˺.,Mustafa Khattab
409,3,116,"Indeed, neither the wealth nor children of the disbelievers will be of any benefit to them against Allah. It is they who will be the residents of the Fire. They will be there forever.",Mustafa Khattab
410,3,117,"The good they do in this worldly life is like the harvest of an evil people struck by a bitter wind, destroying it ˹completely˺. Allah never wronged them, but they wronged themselves.",Mustafa Khattab
411,3,118,"O believers! Do not associate closely with others who would not miss a chance to harm you. Their only desire is to see you suffer. Their prejudice has become evident from what they say—and what their hearts hide is far worse. We have made Our revelations clear to you, if only you understood.",Mustafa Khattab
412,3,119,"Here you are! You love them but they do not love you, and you believe in all Scriptures. When they meet you they say, ""We believe."" But when alone, they bite their fingertips in rage.

413,3,120,"When you ˹believers˺ are touched with good, they grieve; but when you are afflicted with evil, they rejoice. ˹Yet,˺ if you are patient and mindful ˹of Allah˺, their schemes will not harm you in the least. Surely Allah is Fully Aware of what they do.",Mustafa Khattab

415,3,122,"˹Remember˺ when two groups among you ˹believers˺ were about to cower, then Allah reassured them. So in Allah let the believers put their trust.",Mustafa Khattab
416,3,123,"Indeed, Allah made you victorious at Badr when you were ˹vastly˺ outnumbered. So be mindful of Allah, perhaps you will be grateful.",Mustafa Khattab
417,3,124,"˹Remember, O  Prophet,˺ when you said to the believers, ""Is it not enough that your Lord will send down a reinforcement of three thousand angels for your aid?""",Mustafa Khattab
418,3,125,"Most certainly, if you ˹believers˺ are firm and mindful ˹of Allah˺ and the enemy launches a sudden attack on you, Allah will reinforce you with five thousand angels designated ˹for battle˺.",Mustafa Khattab
419,3,126,"Allah ordained this ˹reinforcement˺ only as good news for you and reassurance for your hearts. And victory comes only from Allah—the Almighty, All-Wise—",Mustafa Khattab

430,3,137,"Similar situations came to pass before you, so travel throughout the land and see the fate of the deniers.",Mustafa Khattab
431,3,138,This[1] is an insight to humanity—a guide and a lesson to the God-fearing.,Mustafa Khattab

433,3,140,"If you have suffered injuries ˹at Uḥud˺, they suffered similarly ˹at Badr˺. We alternate these days ˹of victory and defeat˺ among people so that Allah may reveal the ˹true˺ believers, choose martyrs from among you—and Allah does not like the wrongdoers—",Mustafa Khattab
434,3,141,and distinguish the ˹true˺ believers and destroy the disbelievers.,Mustafa Khattab

437,3,144,"Muḥammad is no more than a messenger; other messengers have gone before him. If he were to die or to be killed, would you regress into disbelief? Those who do so will not harm Allah whatsoever. And Allah will reward those who are grateful.",Mustafa Khattab

439,3,146,"˹Imagine˺ how many devotees fought along with their prophets and never faltered despite whatever ˹losses˺ they suffered in the cause of Allah, nor did they weaken or give in! Allah loves those who persevere.",Mustafa Khattab
440,3,147,"And all they said was, ""Our Lord! Forgive our sins and excesses, make our steps firm, and grant us victory over the disbelieving people.""",Mustafa Khattab
441,3,148,So Allah gave them the reward of this world and the excellent reward of the Hereafter. For Allah loves the good-doers.,Mustafa Khattab

443,3,150,"But no! Allah is your Guardian, and He is the best Helper.",Mustafa Khattab
444,3,151,We will cast horror into the hearts of the disbelievers for associating ˹false gods˺ with Allah—a practice He has never authorized. The Fire will be their home—what an evil place for the wrongdoers to stay!,Mustafa Khattab
445,3,152,"Indeed, Allah fulfilled His promise to you when you ˹initially˺ swept them away by His Will, then your courage weakened and you disputed about the command and disobeyed,[1] after Allah had brought victory within your reach. Some of you were after worldly gain while others desired a heavenly reward. He denied you victory over them as a test, yet He has pardoned you. And Allah is Gracious to the believers.",Mustafa Khattab
446,3,153,"˹Remember˺ when you were running far away ˹in panic˺—not looking at anyone—while the Messenger was calling to you from behind! So Allah rewarded your disobedience with distress upon distress. Now, do not grieve over the victory you were denied or the injury you suffered. And Allah is All-Aware of what you do.",Mustafa Khattab
447,3,154,"Then after distress, He sent down serenity in the form of drowsiness overcoming some of you, while others were disturbed by evil thoughts about Allah—the thoughts of ˹pre-Islamic˺ ignorance. They ask, ""Do we have a say in the matter?"" Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “All matters are destined by Allah.” They conceal in their hearts what they do not reveal to you. They say ˹to themselves˺, “If we had any say in the matter, none of us would have come to die here.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Even if you were to remain in your homes, those among you who were destined to be killed would have met the same fate.” Through this, Allah tests what is within you and purifies what is in your hearts.

Do not be like the unfaithful[1] who say about their brothers who travel throughout the land or engage in battle, ""If they had stayed with us, they would not have died or been killed.""

451,3,158,Whether you die or are martyred—all of you will be gathered before Allah.,Mustafa Khattab
452,3,159,"It is out of Allah’s mercy that you ˹O Prophet˺ have been lenient with them. Had you been cruel or hard-hearted, they would have certainly abandoned you. So pardon them, ask Allah’s forgiveness for them, and consult with them in ˹conducting˺ matters. Once you make a decision, put your trust in Allah. Surely Allah loves those who trust in Him.",Mustafa Khattab
453,3,160,"If Allah helps you, none can defeat you. But if He denies you help, then who else can help you? So in Allah let the believers put their trust.",Mustafa Khattab
454,3,161,"It is not appropriate for a prophet to illegally withhold spoils of war. And whoever does so, it will be held against them on the Day of Judgment. Then every soul will be paid in full for what it has done, and none will be wronged.",Mustafa Khattab
455,3,162,Are those who seek Allah’s pleasure like those who deserve Allah’s wrath? Hell is their home. What an evil destination!,Mustafa Khattab
456,3,163,They ˹each˺ have varying degrees in the sight of Allah. And Allah is All-Seeing of what they do.,Mustafa Khattab
457,3,164,"Indeed, Allah has done the believers a ˹great˺ favour by raising a messenger from among them—reciting to them His revelations, purifying them, and teaching them the Book and wisdom. For indeed they had previously been clearly astray.",Mustafa Khattab
458,3,165,"Why is it when you suffered casualties ˹at Uḥud˺—although you had made your enemy suffer twice as much ˹at Badr˺—you protested, ""How could this be?""? Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “It is because of your disobedience.” Surely Allah is Most Capable of everything.",Mustafa Khattab
459,3,166,"So what you suffered on the day the two armies met was by Allah’s Will, so that He might distinguish the ˹true˺ believers",Mustafa Khattab
460,3,167,"and expose the hypocrites. When it was said to them, ""Come fight in the cause of Allah or ˹at least˺ defend yourselves,"" they replied, “If we had known there was fighting, we would have definitely gone with you.” They were closer to disbelief than to belief on that day—for saying with their mouths what was not in their hearts.

740,5,71,"They thought there would be no consequences, so they turned a blind eye and a deaf ear. Yet Allah turned to them in forgiveness ˹after their repentance˺, but again many became blind and deaf. And Allah is All-Seeing of what they do.",Mustafa Khattab
741,5,72,"Those who say, ""Allah is the Messiah, son of Mary,"" have certainly fallen into disbelief. The Messiah ˹himself˺ said, “O Children of Israel! Worship Allah—my Lord and your Lord.” Whoever associates others with Allah ˹in worship˺ will surely be forbidden Paradise by Allah. Their home will be the Fire. And the wrongdoers will have no helpers.",Mustafa Khattab
742,5,73,"Those who say, ""Allah is one in a Trinity,"" have certainly fallen into disbelief. There is only One God. If they do not stop saying this, those who disbelieve among them will be afflicted with a painful punishment.",Mustafa Khattab

751,5,82,You will surely find the most bitter towards the believers to be the Jews and polytheists and the most gracious to be those who call themselves Christian. That is because there are priests and monks among them and because they are not arrogant.,Mustafa Khattab
752,5,83,"When they listen to what has been revealed to the Messenger, you see their eyes overflowing with tears for recognizing the truth. They say, ""Our Lord! We believe, so count us among the witnesses.",Mustafa Khattab

758,5,89,"Allah will not call you to account for your thoughtless oaths, but He will hold you accountable for deliberate oaths.

They adjust the sanctity one year and uphold it in another, only to maintain the number of months sanctified by Allah, violating the very months Allah has made sacred. Their evil deeds have been made appealing to them. And Allah does not guide the disbelieving people.",Mustafa Khattab
1273,9,38,"O believers! What is the matter with you that when you are asked to march forth in the cause of Allah, you cling firmly to ˹your˺ land?[1] Do you prefer the life of this world over the Hereafter? The enjoyment of this worldly life is insignificant compared to that of the Hereafter.",Mustafa Khattab
1274,9,39,"If you do not march forth, He will afflict you with a painful torment and replace you with other people. You are not harming Him in the least. And Allah is Most Capable of everything.",Mustafa Khattab
1275,9,40,"˹It does not matter˺ if you ˹believers˺ do not support him, for Allah did in fact support him when the disbelievers drove him out ˹of Mecca˺ and he was only one of two. While they both were in the cave, he reassured his companion,[1] ""Do not worry; Allah is certainly with us."" So Allah sent down His serenity upon the Prophet, supported him with forces you ˹believers˺ did not see, and made the word of the disbelievers lowest, while the Word of Allah is supreme. And Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.",Mustafa Khattab

And they will swear by Allah, ""Had we been able, we would have certainly joined you."" They are ruining themselves. And Allah knows that they are surely lying.",Mustafa Khattab
1278,9,43,May Allah pardon you ˹O Prophet˺! Why did you give them permission ˹to stay behind˺ before those who told the truth were distinguished from those who were lying?,Mustafa Khattab
1279,9,44,Those who believe in Allah and the Last Day do not ask for exemption from striving with their wealth and their lives. And Allah has perfect knowledge of those who are mindful ˹of Him˺.,Mustafa Khattab
1280,9,45,"No one would ask for exemption except those who have no faith in Allah or the Last Day, and whose hearts are in doubt, so they are torn by their doubts.",Mustafa Khattab
1281,9,46,"Had they ˹really˺ intended to march forth, they would have made preparations for it. But Allah disliked that they should go, so He let them lag behind, and it was said ˹to them˺, ""Stay with those ˹helpless˺ who remain behind.""",Mustafa Khattab
1282,9,47,"Had they gone forth with you ˹believers˺, they would have been nothing but trouble for you, and would have scrambled around, seeking to spread discord in your midst. And some of you would have eagerly listened to them. And Allah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of the wrongdoers.",Mustafa Khattab

And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.",Mustafa Khattab

2150,18,10,"˹Remember˺ when those youths took refuge in the cave, and said, ""Our Lord! Grant us mercy from Yourself and guide us rightly through our ordeal.""",Mustafa Khattab
2151,18,11,"So We caused them to fall into a dead sleep[1] in the cave for many years,",Mustafa Khattab

So pronounce the Name of Allah over them when they are lined up ˹for sacrifice˺. Once they have fallen ˹lifeless˺ on their sides, you may eat from their meat, and feed the needy—those who do not beg, and those who do. In this way We have subjected these ˹animals˺ to you so that you may be grateful.",Mustafa Khattab
2632,22,37,"Neither their meat nor blood reaches Allah. Rather, it is your piety that reaches Him. This is how He has subjected them to you so that you may proclaim the greatness of Allah for what He has guided you to, and give good news to the good-doers.",Mustafa Khattab

3322,28,70,He is Allah. There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him. All praise belongs to Him in this life and the next. All authority is His. And to Him you will ˹all˺ be returned.,Mustafa Khattab
3323,28,71,"Ask ˹them, O  Prophet˺, ""Imagine if Allah were to make the night perpetual for you until the Day of Judgment, which god other than Allah could bring you sunlight? Will you not then listen?""",Mustafa Khattab
3324,28,72,"Ask ˹them also˺, ""Imagine if Allah were to make the day perpetual for you until the Day of Judgment, which god other than Allah could bring you night to rest in? Will you not then see?""",Mustafa Khattab
3325,28,73,"It is out of His mercy that He has made for you the day and night so that you may rest ˹in the latter˺ and seek His bounty ˹in the former˺, and perhaps you will be grateful.",Mustafa Khattab
3326,28,74,"And ˹watch for˺ the Day He will call to them, ""Where are those you claimed were My associate-gods?""",Mustafa Khattab
3327,28,75,"And We will bring forth a witness[1] from every faith-community and ask ˹the polytheists˺, ""Show ˹Us˺ your proof."" Then they will ˹come to˺ know that the truth is with Allah ˹alone˺. And whatever ˹gods˺ they fabricated will fail them.",Mustafa Khattab
3328,28,76,"Indeed, Korah[1] was from the people of Moses, but he behaved arrogantly towards them. We had granted him such treasures that even their keys would burden a group of strong men. ˹Some of˺ his people advised him, ""Do not be prideful! Surely Allah does not like the prideful.",Mustafa Khattab
3329,28,77,"Rather, seek the ˹reward˺ of the Hereafter by means of what Allah has granted you, without forgetting your share of this world. And be good ˹to others˺ as Allah has been good to you. Do not seek to spread corruption in the land, for Allah certainly does not like the corruptors.""",Mustafa Khattab
3330,28,78,"He replied, ""I have been granted all this because of some knowledge I have.""[1] Did he not know that Allah had already destroyed some from the generations before him who were far superior to him in power and greater in accumulating ˹wealth˺? There will be no need for the wicked to be asked about their sins.[2]",Mustafa Khattab
3331,28,79,"Then he came out before his people in all his glamour. Those who desired the life of this world wished, ""If only we could have something like what Korah has been given. He is truly a man of great fortune!""",Mustafa Khattab
3332,28,80,"But those gifted with knowledge said, ""Shame on you! Allah’s reward is far better for those who believe and do good. But none will attain this except the steadfast.""",Mustafa Khattab
3333,28,81,"Then We caused the earth to swallow him up, along with his home. There was no one to help him against Allah, nor could he even help himself.",Mustafa Khattab
3334,28,82,"And those who had craved his position the previous day began to say, ""Ah! It is certainly Allah Who gives abundant or limited provisions to whoever He wills of His servants. Had it not been for the grace of Allah, He could have surely caused the earth to swallow us up! Oh, indeed! The disbelievers will never succeed.""",Mustafa Khattab
3335,28,83,That ˹eternal˺ Home in the Hereafter We reserve ˹only˺ for those who seek neither tyranny nor corruption on the earth. The ultimate outcome belongs ˹only˺ to the righteous.,Mustafa Khattab

3339,28,87,"Do not let them turn you away from the revelations of Allah after they have been sent down to you. Rather, invite ˹all˺ to ˹the Way of˺ your Lord, and never be one of the polytheists.",Mustafa Khattab
3340,28,88,And do not invoke any other god with Allah. There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him. Everything is bound to perish except He Himself.[1] All authority belongs to Him. And to Him you will ˹all˺ be returned.,Mustafa Khattab
3341,29,1,Alif-Lãm-Mĩm.,Mustafa Khattab
3342,29,2,"Do people think once they say, ""We believe,"" that they will be left without being put to the test?",Mustafa Khattab
3343,29,3,We certainly tested those before them. And ˹in this way˺ Allah will clearly distinguish between those who are truthful and those who are liars.,Mustafa Khattab
3344,29,4,Or do the evildoers ˹simply˺ think that they will escape Us? How wrong is their judgment!,Mustafa Khattab
3345,29,5,"Whoever hopes for the meeting with Allah, ˹let them know that˺ Allah’s appointed time is sure to come. He is the All-Hearing, All-Knowing.",Mustafa Khattab

3348,29,8,"We have commanded people to honour their parents. But if they urge you to associate with Me what you have no knowledge of,[1] then do not obey them. To Me you will ˹all˺ return, and then I will inform you of what you used to do.",Mustafa Khattab
3349,29,9,Those who believe and do good will surely be admitted by Us into ˹the company of˺ the righteous.,Mustafa Khattab
3350,29,10,"There are some who say, ""We believe in Allah,"" but when they suffer in the cause of Allah, they mistake ˹this˺ persecution at the hands of people for the punishment of Allah. But when victory comes from your Lord, they surely say ˹to the believers˺, “We have always been with you.” Does Allah not know best what is in the hearts of all beings?",Mustafa Khattab
3351,29,11,Allah will certainly distinguish between those who have ˹sure˺ faith and the hypocrites.,Mustafa Khattab
3352,29,12,"The disbelievers say to the believers, ""˹Just˺ follow our way, and we will bear ˹the burden of˺ your sins."" But they would never ˹want to˺ bear any of the believers’ sins. They are simply lying.",Mustafa Khattab
3353,29,13,"Yet they will certainly ˹be made to˺ carry their own burdens, as well as other burdens along with their own.[1] And they will surely be questioned on Judgment Day about what they used to fabricate.",Mustafa Khattab
3354,29,14,"Indeed, We sent Noah to his people, and he remained among them for a thousand years, less fifty. Then the Flood overtook them, while they persisted in wrongdoing.",Mustafa Khattab
3355,29,15,"But We delivered him and those in the Ark, making it a sign for all people.",Mustafa Khattab
3356,29,16,"And ˹remember˺ when Abraham said to his people, ""Worship Allah, and fear Him. This is better for you, if only you knew.",Mustafa Khattab
3357,29,17,"You worship besides Allah nothing but idols, simply creating lies ˹about them˺. Those you worship besides Allah certainly cannot give you any provision. So seek provision from Allah ˹alone˺, worship Him, and be grateful to Him. To Him you will ˹all˺ be returned.",Mustafa Khattab
3358,29,18,"If you ˹Meccans˺ persist in denial, so did ˹many˺ communities before you. The Messenger’s duty is only to deliver ˹the message˺ clearly.""",Mustafa Khattab
3359,29,19,Have they not seen how Allah originates the creation then resurrects it? That is certainly easy for Allah.,Mustafa Khattab
3360,29,20,"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ ""Travel throughout the land and see how He originated the creation, then Allah will bring it into being one more time. Surely Allah is Most Capable of everything.",Mustafa Khattab

3363,29,23,"As for those who disbelieve in Allah’s signs and the meeting with Him, it is they who will have no hope in His mercy.[1] And it is they who will suffer a painful punishment.",Mustafa Khattab
3364,29,24,"But the only response of Abraham’s people was to say: ""Kill him or burn him!"" But Allah saved him from the fire.[1] Surely in this are signs for people who believe.",Mustafa Khattab
3365,29,25,"He said ˹to his people˺, ""You have taken idols ˹for worship˺ instead of Allah, only to keep ˹the bond of˺ harmony among yourselves in this worldly life.

3369,29,29,"Do you really lust after ˹other˺ men, abuse the travellers, and practice immorality ˹openly˺ in your gatherings?"" His people’s only response was to say ˹mockingly˺: ""Bring Allah’s punishment upon us, if what you say is true.”",Mustafa Khattab
3370,29,30,"Lot prayed, ""My Lord! Help me against the people of corruption.""",Mustafa Khattab
3371,29,31,"When Our messenger-angels came to Abraham with the good news ˹of the birth of Isaac˺, they said, ""We are going to destroy the people of this city ˹of Sodom˺, for its people have persisted in wrongdoing.""",Mustafa Khattab

3375,29,35,And We did leave ˹some of˺ its ruins as a clear lesson for people of understanding.,Mustafa Khattab
3376,29,36,"And to the people of Midian ˹We sent˺ their brother Shu’aib. He said, ""O my people! Worship Allah, and hope for ˹the reward of˺ the Last Day. And do not go about spreading corruption in the land.""",Mustafa Khattab
3377,29,37,"But they rejected him, so an ˹overwhelming˺ earthquake struck them and they fell lifeless in their homes.",Mustafa Khattab
3378,29,38,"And the people of ’Ȃd and Thamûd ˹met a similar fate˺, which must be clear to you ˹Meccans˺ from their ruins.[1] Satan made their ˹evil˺ deeds appealing to them, hindering them from the ˹Right˺ Way, although they were capable of reasoning.",Mustafa Khattab
3379,29,39,"˹We˺ also ˹destroyed˺ Korah, Pharaoh, and Hamân. Indeed, Moses had come to them with clear proofs, but they behaved arrogantly in the land. Yet they could not escape ˹Us˺.",Mustafa Khattab
3380,29,40,"So We seized each ˹people˺ for their sin: against some of them We sent a storm of stones, some were overtaken by a ˹mighty˺ blast, some We caused the earth to swallow, and some We drowned. Allah would not have wronged them, but it was they who wronged themselves.",Mustafa Khattab
3381,29,41,"The parable of those who take protectors other than Allah is that of a spider spinning a shelter. And the flimsiest of all shelters is certainly that of a spider, if only they knew.[1]",Mustafa Khattab

3383,29,43,"These are the parables We set forth for humanity, but none will understand them except the people of knowledge.",Mustafa Khattab

3387,29,47,"Similarly ˹to earlier messengers˺, We have revealed to you a Book ˹O Prophet˺. ˹The faithful of˺ those to whom We gave the Scriptures believe in it, as do some of these ˹pagan Arabs˺. And none denies Our revelations except the ˹stubborn˺ disbelievers.",Mustafa Khattab

This shall be the expiation for your oaths whenever you have sworn (and broken them.)[1] But do keep your oaths.[2] Thus does Allah make clear to you His commandments; maybe you will be grateful.",Abul A'la Maududi

770,5,101,"Believers! Do not ask of the things which, if made manifest to you, would vex you;[1] for, if you should ask about them while the Qur'an is being revealed, they will be made manifest to you.

When death approaches you, let two men of equity among you act as witnesses when you make your bequest;[1] or let two of those from others than yourselves act as witnesses if you are on a journey when the affliction of death befalls you.[2] Then if any doubt occurs you shall detain both of them (in the mosque) after the Prayer, and they shall swear by Allah: 'We shall neither sell our testimony in return for any gain even though it concerns any near of kin nor shall we conceal our testimony which we owe to Allah, for then we should become among sinners.' .",Abul A'la Maududi

1226,8,66,"Allah has now lightened your burden for He found weakness in you. So if there be hundred of you who persevere, they shall vanquish two hundred; and if there be a thousand of you they shall, by the leave of Allah, vanquish two thousand.[1] Allah is with those who persevere.",Abul A'la Maududi
1227,8,67,"It behoves not a Prophet to take captives until he has sufficiently suppressed the enemies in the land. You merely seek the gains of the world whereas Allah desires (for you the good) of the Hereafter. Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.",Abul A'la Maududi

1232,8,72,"Surely those who believed and migrated and strove hard in the way of Allah with their possessions and their lives, and those that sheltered and helped them - they alone are the true allies of one another. And those who believed but did not migrate (to Dar-al-Islam), you are under no obligation of alliance unless they migrate.[1] And should they seek help from you in the matter of religion, it is incumbent on you to provide help unless it be against a people with whom you have a pact.[2] Allah is cognizant of all that you do.",Abul A'la Maududi
1233,8,73,And those who disbelieve. they are allies of one another; and unless you act likewise. there will be oppression in the world and great corruption.[1],Abul A'la Maududi

If you repent, it shall be for your own good; but if you turn away, then know well that you will not be able to frustrate Allah. So give glad tidings of a painful chastisement to those who disbelieve.",Abul A'la Maududi

1243,9,8,"[9:8] How can there be any covenant with the other polytheists for were they to prevail against you, they will respect neither kinship nor agreement. They seek to please you with their tongues while their hearts are averse to you, and most of them are wicked.",Abul A'la Maududi
1244,9,9,[9:9] They have sold the revelations of Allah for a paltry price and have firmly hindered people from His Path. Evil indeed is what they have done.,Abul A'la Maududi
1245,9,10,[9:10] They neither have any respect for kinship nor for agreement in respect of the believers. Such are indeed transgressors.,Abul A'la Maududi
1246,9,11,[9:11] But if they repent and establish Prayer and give Zakah they are your brothers in faith. Thus do We expound Our revelations to those who know.,Abul A'la Maududi

1248,9,13,"[9:13] Will you not fight against those who broke their pledges and did all they could to drive the Messenger away and initiated hostilities against you? Do you fear them? Surely Allah has greater right that you should fear Him, if you are true believers.",Abul A'la Maududi

1253,9,18,[9:18] It only becomes those who believe in Allah and the Last Day and establish Prayer and pay Zakah and fear none but Allah to visit and tend the mosques of Allah. These are likely to be guided aright.,Abul A'la Maududi
1254,9,19,[9:19] Do you consider providing water to the Pilgrims and tending the Sacred Mosque equal in worth to believing in Allah and the Last Day and striving in the cause of Allah? The two are not equal with Allah. Allah does not direct the wrong-doing folk to the Right Way.,Abul A'la Maududi
1255,9,20,[9:20] The higher rank with Allah is for those who believed and migrated and strove in His cause with their belongings and their persons. It is they who are triumphant.,Abul A'la Maududi

Allah does not guide the evil-doing folk.""",Abul A'la Maududi

1261,9,26,"[9:26] Then Allah caused His tranquillity to descend upon His Messenger and upon the believers, and He sent down hosts whom you did not see, and chastised those who disbelieved. Such is the recompense of those who deny the Truth.",Abul A'la Maududi

These are merely verbal assertions in imitation of the sayings of those unbelievers who preceded them. May Allah ruin them. How do they turn away from the Truth?",Abul A'la Maududi
1266,9,31,"[9:31] They take their rabbis and their monks for their lords apart from Allah, and also the Messiah, son of Mary, whereas they were commanded to worship none but the One True God. There is no god but He. Exalted be He above those whom they associate with Him in His Divinity.",Abul A'la Maududi
1267,9,32,[9:32] They seek to extinguish the light of Allah by blowing through their mouths; but Allah refuses everything except that He will perfect His light howsoever the unbelievers might abhor it.,Abul A'la Maududi

1269,9,34,[9:34] Believers! Many of the rabbis and monks wrongfully devour mankind's possessions and hinder people from the Way of Allah. And there are those who amass gold and silver and do not spend it in the Way of Allah. Announce to them the tidings of a painful chastisement,Abul A'la Maududi
1270,9,35,"[9:35] on a Day when they shall be heated up in the Fire of Hell, and their foreheads and their sides and their backs shall be branded with it, (and they shall be told): ""This is the treasure which you hoarded for yourselves. Taste, then, the punishment for what you have hoarded.""",Abul A'la Maududi
1271,9,36,"[9:36] Surely the reckoning of months, in the sight of Allah, is twelve months, laid down in Allah's decree on the day when He created the heavens and the earth; and out of these months four are sacred. That is the true ordainment. Do not, therefore, wrong yourselves, with respect to these months. And fight all together against those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity in the manner that they fight against you all together, and know well that Allah is with the God-fearing.",Abul A'la Maududi
1272,9,37,"[9:37] The intercalation (of sacred months) is an act of gross infidelity which causes the unbelievers to be led further astray. They declare a month to be lawful in one year and forbidden in another year in order that they may conform to the number of months that Allah has declared as sacred, and at the same time make lawful what Allah has forbidden. Their foul acts seem fair to them. Allah does not direct those who deny the Truth to the Right Way.",Abul A'la Maududi
1273,9,38,"[9:38] Believers! What is amiss with you that when it is said to you: ""March forth in the cause of Allah,"" you cling heavily to the earth?

1275,9,40,"[9:40] It will matter little if you do not help the Prophet, for Allah surely helped him when the unbelievers drove him out of his home and he was but one of the two when they were in the cave, and when he said to his companion: ""Do not grieve. Allah is with us."" Then Allah caused His tranquillity to descend upon him, and supported him with hosts you did not see, He humbled the word of the unbelievers. As for Allah's Word, it is inherently uppermost. Allah is All-Powerful, All-Wise.",Abul A'la Maududi

Still they will swear by Allah: ""If only we could, we would surely have gone forth with you."" They merely bring ruin upon themselves. Allah knows well that they are liars.",Abul A'la Maududi
1278,9,43,"[9:43] (O Prophet), may Allah forgive you! Why did you give them leave to stay behind before it became clear to you as to who were truthful and who were liars?",Abul A'la Maududi
1279,9,44,[9:44] Those who believe in Allah and the Last Day will never ask your leave to be excused from striving (in the cause of Allah) with their belongings and their lives. Allah fully knows the God-fearing.,Abul A'la Maududi

1283,9,48,"[9:48] Surely they sought even earlier to stir up sedition, and turned things upside down to frustrate you until the Truth came and the decree of Allah appeared, however hateful this may have been to them.",Abul A'la Maududi

And so, ignominy and humiliation overshadowed them, and they earned the burden of God's condemnation: all this, because they persisted in denying the truth of God's messages and in slaying the prophets against all right: all this, because they rebelled [against God], and persisted in transgressing the bounds of what is right.",Muhammad Asad

445,3,152,"AND, INDEED, God made good His promise unto you when, by His leave, you were about to destroy your foes - until the moment when you lost heart and acted contrary to the [Prophet's] command, and disobeyed after He had brought you within view of that [victory] for which you were longing. There were among you such as cared for this world [alone], just as there were among you such as cared for the life to come: whereupon, in order that He might put you to a test, He prevented you from defeating your foes.

447,3,154,"Then, after this woe, He sent down upon you a sense of security, an inner calm which enfolded some of you, whereas the others, who cared mainly for themselves, entertained wrong thoughts about God - thoughts of pagan ignorance - saying, ""Did we, then, have any power of decision [in this matter]?"" Say: ""Verily, all power of decision does rest with God"" - [but as for them,] they are trying to conceal within themselves that [weakness of faith] which they would not reveal unto thee, [O Prophet, by] saying, ""If we had any power of decision, we would not have left so many dead behind. "" Say [unto them]: ""Even if you had remained in your homes, those [of you] whose death had been ordained would indeed have gone forth to the places where they were destined to lie down.""

Take hold of the two after having prayed; and if you have any doubt in your mind, let each of them swear by God, ""We shall not sell this [our word] for any price, even though it were [for the sake of] a near kinsman; and neither shall we conceal aught of what we have witnessed before God -or else, may we indeed be counted among the sinful.""",Muhammad Asad

915,6,126,"And undeviating is this thy Sustainer's way. Clearly, indeed, have We spelled out these messages unto people who [are willing to] take them to heart!",Muhammad Asad

1615,12,19,"AND THERE CAME a caravan; and they sent forth their drawer of water, and he let down his bucket into the well - [and when he saw Joseph] he exclaimed: ""Oh, what a lucky find, this boy!"" And they hid him with a view to selling him: but God had full knowledge of all that they were doing.",Muhammad Asad
1616,12,20,And they sold him for a paltry price - a mere few silver coins: thus low did they value him.,Muhammad Asad
1617,12,21,"And the man from Egypt who bought him said to his wife: ""Make his stay [with us] honourable; he may well be of use to us, or we may adopt him as a son. And thus We gave unto Joseph a firm place on earth; and [We did this] so that We might impart unto him some understanding of the inner meaning of happenings. For, God always prevails in whatever be His purpose: but most people know it not.",Muhammad Asad
1618,12,22,"And when he reached full manhood, We bestowed upon him the ability to judge [between right and wrong], as well as [innate] knowledge: for thus do We reward the doers of good.",Muhammad Asad
1619,12,23,"And [it so happened that] she in whose house he was living [conceived a passion for him and] sought to make him yield himself unto her; and she bolted the doors and said, ""Come thou unto me!"" [But Joseph] answered: ""May God preserve me! Behold, goodly has my master made my stay [in this house]! Verily, to no good end come they that do [such] wrong!""",Muhammad Asad
1620,12,24,"And, indeed, she desired him, and he desired her; [and he would have succumbed] had he not seen [in this temptation] an evidence of his Sustainer's truth: thus [We willed it to be] in order that We might avert from him all evil and all deeds of abomination -for, behold, he was truly one of Our servants.",Muhammad Asad
1621,12,25,"And they both rushed to the door; and she [grasped and] rent his tunic from behind-and [lo!] they met her lord at the door! Said she: ""What ought to be the punishment of one who had evil designs on [the virtue of] thy wife - [what] but imprisonment or a [yet more] grievous chastisement?""",Muhammad Asad
1622,12,26,"[Joseph] exclaimed: ""It was she who sought to make me yield myself unto her!"" Now one of those present, a member of her own household, suggested this: If his tunic has been torn from the front, then she is telling the truth, and he is a liar;",Muhammad Asad
1623,12,27,"but if his tunic has been torn from behind, then she is lying, and he is speaking the truth. """,Muhammad Asad
1624,12,28,"And when (her husband] saw that his tunic was torn from behind, he said: ""Behold, this is [an instance] of your guile, O womankind! Verily, awesome is your guile!",Muhammad Asad
1625,12,29,"[But, ] Joseph, let this pass! And thou, [O wife,] ask forgiveness for thy sin-for, verily, thou hast been greatly at fault!""",Muhammad Asad
1626,12,30,"NOW the women of the city spoke [thus to one another]: ""The wife of this nobleman is trying to induce her slave-boy to yield himself unto her! Her love for him has pierced her heart; verily, we see that she is undoubtedly suffering from an aberration!",Muhammad Asad
1627,12,31,"Thereupon, when she heard of their malicious talk, she sent for them, and prepared for them a sumptuous repast, and handed each of them a knife and said [to Joseph]: ""Come out and show thyself to them!"" And when the women saw him, they were greatly amazed at his beauty, and [so flustered were they that] they cut their hands [with their knives], exclaiming, ""God save us! This is no mortal man! This is nought but a noble angel!""",Muhammad Asad
1628,12,32,"Said she: ""This, then, is he about whom you have been blaming me! And, indeed, I did try to make him yield himself unto me, but he remained chaste. Now, however, if he does not do what I bid him, he shall most certainly be imprisoned, and shall most certainly find himself among the despised!",Muhammad Asad
1629,12,33,"Said he: ""O my Sustainer! Prison is more desirable to me than [compliance with] what these women invite me to: for, unless Thou turn away their guile from me, I might yet yield to their allure and become one of those who are unaware [of right and wrong]. """,Muhammad Asad
1630,12,34,"And his Sustainer responded to his prayer, and freed him from the threat of their guile: verily, He alone is all-hearing, all-knowing.",Muhammad Asad
1631,12,35,"For, presently it occurred to the nobleman and his household _ [even] after they had seen all the signs [of Joseph's innocence] - that they might as well imprison him for a time.",Muhammad Asad
1632,12,36,"NOW two young men happened to go to prison at the same time as Joseph. One of them said: ""Behold, I saw myself [in a dream] pressing wine."" And the other said: ""Behold, I saw myself [in a dream] carrying bread on my head, and birds were eating thereof."" [And both entreated Joseph:] ""Let us know the real meaning of this! Verily, we see that thou art one of those who know well [how to interpret dreams].",Muhammad Asad
1633,12,37,"[Joseph] answered: ""Ere there comes unto you the meal which you are [daily] fed, I shall have informed you of the real meaning of your dreams, [so that you might know what is to come] before it comes unto you: for this is [part] of the knowledge which my Sustainer has imparted to me. ""Behold, I have left behind me the ways of people who do not believe in God, and who persistently refuse to acknowledge the truth of the life to come;",Muhammad Asad
1634,12,38,"and I follow the creed of my forefathers Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. It is not conceivable that we should [be allowed to] ascribe divinity to aught beside God: this is [an outcome] of God's bounty unto us and unto all mankind -but most people are ungrateful.",Muhammad Asad
1635,12,39,"""O my companions in imprisonment! Which is more reasonable: [belief in the existence of numerous divine] lords, each of them different from the other"" -or [in] the One God, who holds absolute sway over all that exists?",Muhammad Asad
1636,12,40,"""All that you worship instead of God is nothing but [empty] names which you have invented - you and your forefathers- [and] for which God has bestowed no warrant from on high. Judgment [as to what is right and what is wrong] rests with God alone-[and] He has ordained that you should worship nought but Him: this is the [one] ever-true faith; but most people know it not",Muhammad Asad
1637,12,41,"""[And now, ] O my companions in imprisonment, [I shall tell you the meaning of your dreams:] as for one of you two, he will [again] give his lord [the King] wine to drink; but as for the other, he will be crucified, and birds will eat off his head. [But whatever be your future,] the matter on which you have asked me to enlighten you has been decided [by God].""",Muhammad Asad
1638,12,42,"And [thereupon Joseph] said unto the one of the two whom he considered saved: ""Mention me unto thy lord [when thou art free]!"" But Satan caused him to forget to mention [Joseph] to his lord, and so he remained in prison a few [more] years.",Muhammad Asad
1639,12,43,"AND [one day] the King said: Behold, I saw [in a dream] seven fat cows being devoured by seven emaciated ones, and seven green ears [of wheat] next to [seven] others that were withered. O you nobles! Enlighten me about [the meaning of] my dream, if you are able to interpret dreams!""",Muhammad Asad
1640,12,44,"They answered: "" [This is one of] the most involved and confusing of dreams, and we have no deep knowledge of the real meaning of dreams. """,Muhammad Asad
1641,12,45,"At that, the one of the two [erstwhile prisoners] who had been saved, and [who suddenly] remembered [Joseph] after all that time, spoke [thus]: ""It is I who can inform you of the real meaning of this [dream]; so let me go [in search of it]. """,Muhammad Asad
1642,12,46,"[And he went to see Joseph in the prison and said to him:] ""Joseph, O thou truthful one! Enlighten us about [the meaning of a dream in which] seven fat cows were being devoured by seven emaciated ones, and seven green ears [of wheat appeared] next to [seven] others that were withered - so that I may return [with thy explanation] unto the people [of the court, and] that they may come to know [what manner of man thou art]!""",Muhammad Asad
1643,12,47,"[Joseph] replied: ""You shall sow for seven years as usual; but let all [the grain] that you harvest remain [untouched] in its ear, excepting only a little, whereof you may eat:",Muhammad Asad
1644,12,48,"for, after that [period of seven good years] there will come seven hard [years] which will devour all that you shall have laid up for them, excepting only a little of that which you shall have kept in store.",Muhammad Asad
1645,12,49,"And after that there will come a year in which the people will be delivered from all distress, and in which they will press [oil and wine as before]. """,Muhammad Asad
1646,12,50,"And [as soon as Joseph's interpretation. was conveyed to him, ] the King said: ""Bring him before me!"" But when the [King's] messenger came unto him, [Joseph] said: ""Go back to thy lord and ask him [first to find out the truth] about those women who cut their hands-for, behold, [until now it is] my Sustainer [alone who] has full knowledge of their guile!""",Muhammad Asad
1647,12,51,"[Thereupon the King sent for those women; and when they came, ] he asked: ""What was it that you hoped to achieve when you sought to make Joseph yield himself unto you?"" The women answered: ""God save us! We did not perceive the least evil [intention] on his part!"" [And] the wife of Joseph's former master exclaimed: ""Now has the truth come to light! It was I who sought to make him yield himself unto me - whereas he, behold, was indeed speaking the truth!""",Muhammad Asad
1648,12,52,"[When Joseph learned what had happened, he said: ""I asked for] this, so that [my former master] might know that I did not betray him behind his back, and that God does not bless with His guidance the artful schemes of those who betray their trust.",Muhammad Asad
1649,12,53,"And yet, I am not trying to absolve myself: for, verily, man's inner self does incite [him] to evil, and saved are only they upon whom my Sustainer bestows His grace. Behold, my Sustainer is much forgiving, a dispenser of grace!""",Muhammad Asad
1650,12,54,"And the King said: ""Bring him unto me, so that I may attach him to my own person. "" And when he had spoken with him, [the King] said: ""Behold, [from] this day thou shalt be of high standing with us, invested with all trust!""",Muhammad Asad
1651,12,55,"[Joseph] replied: ""Place in my charge the store-houses of the land; behold, I shall be a good and knowing keeper.",Muhammad Asad
1652,12,56,"And thus We established Joseph securely in the land [of Egypt]: he had full mastery over it, [doing] whatever he willed. [Thus do] We cause Our grace to alight upon whomever We will; and We do not fail to requite the doers of good.",Muhammad Asad
1653,12,57,"But in the eyes of those who have attained to faith and have always been conscious of Us, a reward in the life to come is a far greater good [than any reward in this world].",Muhammad Asad
1654,12,58,"AND [after some years, ] Joseph's brothers came [to Egypt] and presented themselves before him: and he knew them [at once], whereas they did not recognize him.",Muhammad Asad
1655,12,59,"And when he had provided them with their provisions, he said: ""[When you come here next,] bring unto me that brother of yours from your father's side. Do you not see that I have given [you] full measure and have been the best of hosts?",Muhammad Asad
1656,12,60,"But if you do not bring him unto me, you shall never again receive a single measure [of grain] from me, nor shall you [be allowed to] come near me!""",Muhammad Asad
1657,12,61,"They answered: ""We shall try to persuade his father to part with him, and, verily, we shall do [our utmost]!""",Muhammad Asad
1658,12,62,"And [Joseph] said to his servants: ""Place their merchandise in their camel-packs, so that they may find it there when they come home, and hence be the more eager to return.",Muhammad Asad
1659,12,63,"And so, when they returned to their father, [Joseph's brothers] said: ""O our father! All grain is [to be] withheld from us [in the future unless we bring Benjamin with us]: send, therefore, our brother with us, so that we may obtain our measure (of grain]; and, verily, we shall guard him well!""",Muhammad Asad
1660,12,64,"[Jacob] replied: ""Shall I trust you with him in the same way as I trusted you with his brother (Joseph] aforetime? [Nay, ] but God's guardianship is better [than yours], for He is the most merciful of the merciful!""",Muhammad Asad
1661,12,65,"Thereupon, when they opened their packs, they discovered that their merchandise had been returned to them; [and] they said: ""O our father! What more could we desire? Here is our merchandise: it has been returned to us! [If thou send Benjamin with us,] we shall (again] be able to bring food for our family, and shall guard our brother [well], and receive in addition another camel-load of grain That [which we have brought the first time] was but a scanty measure. """,Muhammad Asad
1662,12,66,"Said [Jacob]: ""I will not send him with you until you give me a solemn pledge, before God, that you will indeed bring him back unto me, unless you yourselves be encompassed [by death]!"" And when they had given him their solemn pledge, [Jacob] said: ""God is witness to all that we say!""",Muhammad Asad
1663,12,67,"And he added: ""O my sons! Do not enter [the city all] by one gate, but enter by different gates. Yet [even so,] I can be of no avail whatever to you against [anything that may be willed by] God: judgment [as to what is to happen] rests with none but God. In Him have I placed my trust: for, all who have trust [in His existence] must place their trust in Him alone.""",Muhammad Asad
1664,12,68,"But although they entered [Joseph's city] in the way their father had bidden them, this proved of no avail whatever to them against [the plan of] God [His request] had served only to satisfy Jacob's heartfelt desire [to protect them]: for, behold, thanks to what We had imparted unto him, he was indeed endowed with the knowledge [that God's will must always prevail]; but most people know it not.",Muhammad Asad
1665,12,69,"AND WHEN [the sons of Jacob] presented themselves before Joseph, he drew his brother [Benjamin] unto himself, saying [to him in secret]: ""Behold, I am thy brother! So grieve thou not over their past doings!""",Muhammad Asad
1666,12,70,"And [later, ] when he had provided them with their provisions, he placed the [King's] drinking-cup in his brother's camel-pack. And [as they were leaving the city,] a herald called out: ""O you people of the caravan! Verily, you are thieves!",Muhammad Asad
1667,12,71,"Turning towards the herald and his companions, the brothers asked: ""What is it that you miss?""",Muhammad Asad
1668,12,72,"They answered: ""We miss the King's goblet; and he who produces it shall receive a camel-load [of grain as reward]!"" And [the herald added:] ""I pledge myself to this _ [promise]!""",Muhammad Asad
1669,12,73,"Said [the brothers]: ""By God! Well do you know that we have not come to commit deeds of corruption in this land, and that we have not been thieving!""",Muhammad Asad
1670,12,74,"[The Egyptians] said: ""But what shall be the requital of this [deed] if you are [proved to be] liars?""",Muhammad Asad
1671,12,75,"[The brothers] replied: ""Its requital? He in whose camel-pack [the cup] is found-he shall be [enslaved as] a requital thereof! Thus do we [ourselves] requite the doers of [such] wrong.",Muhammad Asad
1672,12,76,"Thereupon [they were brought before Joseph to be searched; and] he began with the bags of his half-brothers before the bag of his brother [Benjamin]: and in the end he brought forth the drinking Cups out of his brother's bag. In this way did We contrive for Joseph [the attainment of his heart's desire]: under the King's law, he would [otherwise] not have been able to detain his brother, had not God so willed. We do raise to [high] degrees [of knowledge] whomever We will - but above everyone who is endowed with knowledge there is One who knows all.",Muhammad Asad
1673,12,77,"[As soon as the cup came to light out of Benjamin's bag, the brothers] exclaimed: ""If he has stolen-well, a brother of his used to steal afore-time!"" Thereupon Joseph said to himself, without revealing his thought to them: ""You are far worse in this respect, and God is fully aware of what you are saying.",Muhammad Asad
1674,12,78,"They said: ""O thou great one! Behold, he has a father, a very old man: detain, therefore, one of us in his stead. Verily, we see that thou art a doer of good!""",Muhammad Asad
1675,12,79,"He answered: ""May God preserve us from [the sin of] detaining any other than him with whom we have found our property-for then, behold, we would indeed be evildoers!""",Muhammad Asad
1676,12,80,"And so, when they lost all hope of [moving] him, they withdrew to take counsel [among themselves]. The eldest of them said: ""Do you not remember that your father has bound you by a solemn pledge before God - and how, before that, you had failed with regard to Joseph? Hence, I shall not depart from this land till my father gives me leave or God passes judgment in my favour: for He is the best of all judges.",Muhammad Asad
1677,12,81,"[And as for you others, ] return to your father and say: `O our father! Behold, thy son has stolen-but we [can] bear witness to no more than what has become known to us; and [although we gave you our pledge,] we could not guard against something that [lay hidden in the future and, hence,] was beyond the reach of our perception.",Muhammad Asad
1678,12,82,"And ask thou in the town in which we were [at the time], and of the people of the caravan with whom we travelled hither, and [thou wilt find that] we, are indeed telling the truth!""'",Muhammad Asad
1679,12,83,"[AND WHEN they returned to their father and told him what had happened, ] he exclaimed: ""Nay, but it is your [own] minds that have made [so terrible] a happening seem a matter of little account to you! But [as for myself,] patience in adversity is most goodly; God may well bring them all [back] unto me: verily, He alone is all-knowing, truly wise!""",Muhammad Asad
1680,12,84,"But he turned away from them and said: ""O woe is me for Joseph!""-and his eyes became dim from the grief with which he was filled.",Muhammad Asad
1681,12,85,"Said [his sons]: ""By God! Thou wilt never cease to remember, Joseph till thou art broken in body and spirit or art dead!""",Muhammad Asad
1682,12,86,"He answered: ""It is only to God that I complain of my deep grief and my sorrow: for I know, from God, something that you do not know.",Muhammad Asad
1683,12,87,"[Hence, ] O my sons, go forth and try to obtain some tidings of Joseph and his brother; and do not lose hope of God's life-giving mercy: verily, none but people who deny the truth can ever lose hope of God's life-giving mercy.",Muhammad Asad
1684,12,88,"[AND THE SONS of Jacob went back to Egypt and to Joseph;] and when they presented themselves before him, they said: ""O thou great one! Hardship has visited us and our folk, and so we have brought but scanty merchandise; but give us a full measure [of grain], and be charitable to us: behold, God rewards those who give in charity!""",Muhammad Asad
1685,12,89,"Replied he: ""Do you remember what you did to Joseph and his brother when you were still unaware [of right and wrong]?""",Muhammad Asad
1686,12,90,"They exclaimed: ""Why - is it indeed thou who art Joseph?"" He answered: ""I am Joseph, and this is my brother. God has indeed been gracious unto us. Verily, if one is conscious of Him and patient in adversity behold, God does not fail to requite the doers of good!""",Muhammad Asad
1687,12,91,"[The brothers] said: ""By God! Most certainly has God raised thee high above us, and we were indeed but sinners!""",Muhammad Asad
1688,12,92,"Said he: ""No reproach shall be uttered today against you. May God forgive you your sins: for He is the most merciful of the merciful!",Muhammad Asad
1689,12,93,"[And now] go and take this tunic of mine and lay it over my father's face, and he will recover his sight. And thereupon come [back] to me with all your family.""",Muhammad Asad
1690,12,94,"AND AS SOON as the caravan [with which Jacob's sons were travelling] was on its way, their father said [to the people around him]: ""Behold, were it not that you might consider me a dotard, [I would say that] I truly feel the breath of Joseph [in the air]!""",Muhammad Asad
1691,12,95,"They answered: ""By God! Thou art indeed still lost in thy old aberration!""",Muhammad Asad
1692,12,96,"But when the bearer of good tidings came [with Joseph's tunic], he laid it over his face; and he regained his sight, [and] exclaimed: ""Did I not tell you, `Verily, I know, from God, something that you do not know'?""",Muhammad Asad
1693,12,97,"[His sons] answered: ""O our father! Ask God to forgive us our sins, for, verily, we were sinners. """,Muhammad Asad
1694,12,98,"He said: ""I shall ask my Sustainer to forgive you: He alone is truly forgiving, a true dispenser of grace!""",Muhammad Asad
1695,12,99,"AND WHEN they [all arrived in Egypt and] presented themselves before Joseph, he drew his parents unto himself, saying, ""Enter Egypt! If God so wills, you shall be secure [from all evil]!""",Muhammad Asad
1696,12,100,"And he raised his parents to the highest place of honour; and they [all] fell down before Him, prostrating themselves in adoration. Thereupon [Joseph] said: ""O my father! This is the real meaning of my dream of long ago, which my Sustainer has made come true. And He was indeed good to me when He freed me from the prison, and [when] He brought you [all unto me] from the desert after Satan had sown discord between me and my brothers. Verily, my Sustainer is unfathomable in [the way He brings about] whatever He wills: verily, He alone is all-knowing, truly wise!",Muhammad Asad

1698,12,102,"THIS ACCOUNT of something that was beyond the reach of thy perception We [now] reveal unto thee, [O Prophet:] for thou wert not with Joseph's brothers when they resolved upon what they were going to do and wove their schemes [against him].",Muhammad Asad

1707,12,111,"Indeed, in the stories of these men there is a lesson for those who are endowed with insight.

2152,18,12,"and then We awakened Christianity was no longer persecuted and had even become the official religion of the Roman Empire. The ancient coin (dating from the reign of Decius) with which the young man wanted to pay for his purchases immediately aroused curiosity; people began to question the stranger, and the story of the Men of the Cave and their miraculous sleep came to light. them: [and We did all this] so that We might mark out [to the world] which of the two points of view showed a better comprehension of the time-span during which they had remained in this state.",Muhammad Asad
2153,18,13,"[And now] We shall truly relate to thee their story: Behold, they were young men who had attained to faith in their Sustainer: and [so] We deepened their consciousness of the right way",Muhammad Asad

2155,18,15,"These people of ours have taken to worshipping [other] deities instead of Him, without being able to adduce any reasonable evidence in support of their beliefs; and who could be more wicked than he who invents a lie about God?",Muhammad Asad
2156,18,16,"Hence, now that you have withdrawn from them and from all that they worship instead of God, take refuge in that cave: God will spread His grace over you, and will endow you - whatever your [outward] condition - with all that your souls may need!",Muhammad Asad

I have been sinning against myself thy worshipping aught but Thee]: but [now] I have surrendered myself, with Solomon, unto the Sustainer of all the worlds!”",Muhammad Asad

3259,28,7,"And so, [when he was born,] We inspired [thus] the mother of Moses: Suckle him [for a time], and then, when thou hast cause to fear for him, cast him into the river, and have no fear and do not grieve - for We shall restore him to thee, and shall make him one of Our message-bearers!""",Muhammad Asad
3260,28,8,"And [some of] Pharaoh’s household found [and spared] him: for [We had willed] that he becomes an enemy unto them and [a source of] grief, seeing that Pharaoh and Haman and their hosts were sinners indeed!",Muhammad Asad
3261,28,9,"Now the wife of Pharaoh said: ""A joy to the eye [could this child be] for me and thee! Slay him not: he may well be of use to us, or we may adopt him as a son!"" And they had no presentiment [of what he was to become].",Muhammad Asad
3262,28,10,"On the morrow, however, an aching void grew up in the heart of the mother of Moses, and she would indeed have disclosed all about him had We not endowed her heart with enough strength to keep alive her faith [in Our promise].",Muhammad Asad
3263,28,11,"And so she said to his sister, ""Follow him"" - and [the girl] watched him from afar, while they [who had taken him in] were not aware of it,",Muhammad Asad
3264,28,12,"Now from the very beginning We caused him to refuse the breast of [Egyptian] nurses; and [when his sister came to know this, ] she said: ""Shall I guide you to a family that might rear him for you, and look after him with good will?""",Muhammad Asad
3265,28,13,"And thus We restored him to his mother, so that her eye might he gladdened, and that she might grieve no longer, and that she might know that God’s promise always comes true - even though most of them know it not!",Muhammad Asad
3266,28,14,Now when [Moses] reached full manhood and had become mature [of mind]. We bestowed upon him the ability to judge [between right and wrong] as well as [innate] knowledge: for thus do We reward the doers of good.,Muhammad Asad
3267,28,15,"And [one day] he entered the city at a time when [most of] its people were [resting in their houses, ] unaware of what was going on [in the streets]; and there he encountered two men fighting with one another - one of his own people, and the other of his enemies. And the one who belonged to his own people cried out to him for help against him who was of his enemies - whereupon Moses struck him down with his fist, and [thus] brought about his end. [But then] he said [to himself]: ""This is of Satan’s doing! Verily, he is an open foe, leading [man] astray!""",Muhammad Asad
3268,28,16,"[And] he prayed: O my Sustainer! Verily, I have sinned against myself! Grant me, then, Thy forgiveness!"" And He forgave him - for, verily, He alone is truly forgiving, a dispenser of grace.",Muhammad Asad
3269,28,17,"Said he: ""O my Sustainer! [I vow] by all the blessings which Thou hast bestowed on me: Never­more shall I aid such as are lost in sin!""",Muhammad Asad
3270,28,18,"And next morning he found himself in the city, looking fearfully about him, when lo! the one who had sought his help the day before [once again] cried out to him [for help whereupon] Moses said unto him: ""Behold, thou art indeed, most clearly, deeply in the wrong!",Muhammad Asad
3271,28,19,"But then as soon as he was about to lay violent hands on the man who was their [common] enemy, the latter exclaimed: ""O Moses, dost thou intend to slay me as thou didst slay another man yesterday? Thy sole aim is to become a tyrant in this land, for thou dost not care to be of those who would set things to rights!""",Muhammad Asad
3272,28,20,"And [then and there] a man came running from the farthermost end of the city, and said: ""O Moses! Behold, the great ones [of the kingdom] are deli­berating upon thy case with a view to killing thee! Begone, then: verily, I am of those who wish thee well!""",Muhammad Asad
3273,28,21,"So he went forth from thence, looking fearfully about him, and prayed: ""O my Sustainer! Save me from all evildoing folk!""",Muhammad Asad
3274,28,22,"And as he turned his face towards Madyan, he said [to himself]: ""It may well be that my Sustainer will [thus] guide me onto the right path""",Muhammad Asad
3275,28,23,"NOW WHEN he arrived at the wells of Madyan, he found there a large group of men who were watering [their herds and flocks]; and at some distance from them he came upon two women who were keeping back their flock. He asked [them]: ""What is the matter with you?"" They answered: “We cannot water [our animals] until the herdsmen drive [theirs] home - for [we are weak and] our father is a very old man.”",Muhammad Asad
3276,28,24,"So he watered [their flock] for them: and when he withdrew into the shade and prayed: ""O my Sus­tainer! Verily, in dire need am I of any good which Thou mayest bestow upon me!""",Muhammad Asad
3277,28,25,"[Shortly] afterwards, one of the two [maidens] approached him, walking shyly, and said: ""Behold, my father invites thee, so that he might duly reward thee for thy having watered [our flock] for us. "" And as soon as [Moses] came unto him and told him the story [of his life], he said: “Have no fear! Thou art now safe from those evildoing folk!”",Muhammad Asad
3278,28,26,"Said one of the two [daughters]: ""O my father! Hire him: for, behold, the best [man] that thou couldst hire is one who is [as] strong and worthy of trust [as he]!""",Muhammad Asad
3279,28,27,"[After some time, the father] said: ""Behold, I am willing to let thee wed one of these two daughters of mine on the understanding that thou wilt remain eight years in my service; and if thou shouldst com­plete ten [years], that would be [an act of grace] from thee, for I do not want to impose any hardship on thee: [on the contrary,] thou wilt find me, if God so wills, righteous in all my dealings. """,Muhammad Asad
3280,28,28,"Answered [Moses]: ""Thus shall it be between me and thee! Whichever of the two terms I fulfill, let there be no ill will against me. And God be witness to all that we say!""",Muhammad Asad
3281,28,29,"And when Moses had fulfilled his term and was wandering with his family [in the desert], he per­ceived a fire on the slope of Mount Sinai; [and so] he said to his family: ""Wait here. Behold, I perceive a fire [far away]; perhaps I may bring you from there some tiding, or [at least] a burning brand from the fire, so that you might warm yourselves.",Muhammad Asad
3282,28,30,"But when he came close to it, a call was sounded from the right-side bank of the valley, out of the tree [burning] on blessed ground: ""O Moses! Verily, I am God, the Sustainer of all the worlds!""",Muhammad Asad
3283,28,31,"And [then He said]: ""Throw down thy staff!"" But as soon as [Moses] saw it move rapidly, as if it were a snake, he drew back [in terror], and did not [dare to] return. [And God spoke to him again:] “O Moses! Draw near, and have no fear - for, behold, thou art of those who are secure [in this world and in the next]!",Muhammad Asad
3284,28,32,"""[And now] put thy hand into thy bosom: it will come forth [shining] white, without blemish. And [henceforth] hold thine arm close to thyself, free of all fear. “These, then, shall be the two signs [of thy bearing a message] from thy Sustainer unto Pharaoh and his great ones - for, behold, they are people depraved!""",Muhammad Asad
3285,28,33,"Said [Moses] ""O my Sustainer! I have slain one of them, and so I fear that they will slay me.",Muhammad Asad
3286,28,34,"And my brother Aaron - he is far better in speech than I am. Send him, therefore, as a helper, so that he might [more eloquently] bear witness to my speaking the truth: for I fear indeed that they will give me the lie.""",Muhammad Asad
3287,28,35,"Said He: ""We shall strengthen thine arm through thy brother, and endow both of you with power, so that they will not be able to touch you: by virtue of Our messages shall you two, and all who follow you, prevail!""",Muhammad Asad
3288,28,36,"But as soon as Moses came unto them with Our clear messages [Pharaoh and his great ones] said: ""All this is nothing but spellbinding eloquence devised [by man]: and never did we hear [the like of] this, [nor has it ever been heard of] in the time of our forebears of old!""",Muhammad Asad
3289,28,37,"And Moses replied: ""My Sustainer knows best as to who comes with guidance from Him, and to whom the future belongs! Verily, never will evil­doers attain to a happy state!""",Muhammad Asad
3290,28,38,"Whereupon Pharaoh said: ""O you nobles! I did not know that you could have any deity other than myself Well, then, O Haman, kindle me a fire for [baking bricks of] clay, and then build me a lofty tower, that haply I may have a look at the god of Moses although, behold, I am convinced that he is of those who [always] tell lies!""",Muhammad Asad
3291,28,39,"Thus arrogantly, without the least good sense, did he and his hosts behave on earth - just as if they thought that they would never have to appear before Us [for judgment]!",Muhammad Asad
3292,28,40,And so We seized him and his hosts and cast them into the sea: and behold what happened in the end to those evildoers:,Muhammad Asad
3293,28,41,"[We destroyed them, ] and We set them up as archetypes [of evil] that show the way to the fire [of hell]; and [whereas] no succour will come to them on Resurrection Day,",Muhammad Asad
3294,28,42,We have caused a curse to follow them in this world as well; and on Resurrection Day they will find themselves among those who are bereft of all good.,Muhammad Asad
3295,28,43,"And [then, ] indeed, after We had destroyed those earlier generations [of sinners], We vouchsafed unto Moses [Our] revelation as a means of insight for men, and as a guidance and grace, so that they might bethink themselves [of Us].",Muhammad Asad
3296,28,44,"NOW [as for thee, O Muhammad,] thou wert not present on the sunset slope [of Mount Sinai] when We imposed the Law upon Moses, nor wert thou among those who witnessed [his times]:",Muhammad Asad
3297,28,45,"nay, but [between them and thee] We brought into being [many] generations, and long was their span of life. And neither didst thou dwell among the people of Madyan, conveying Our messages unto them: nay, but We have [always] been sending [Our message-bearers unto man].",Muhammad Asad
3298,28,46,"And neither wert thou present on the slope of Mount Sinai when We called out [to Moses]: but [thou, too, art sent] as an act of thy Sustainer’s grace, to warn people to whom no warner has come before thee, so that they might bethink themselves [of Us];",Muhammad Asad
3299,28,47,"and [We have sent thee] lest they say [on Judg­ment Day], when disaster befalls them as an outcome of what their own hands have wrought, ""O our Sus­tainer, if only Thou had sent an apostle unto us, we would have followed Thy messages, and would have been among those who believe!""",Muhammad Asad
3300,28,48,"And yet, now that the truth has come unto them from Us, they say, ""Why has he not been vouch­safed the like of what Moses was vouchsafed?"" But did they not also, before this, deny the truth of what Moses was vouchsafed? [For] they do say, “Two examples of delusion, [seemingly] supporting each other!” And they add, “Behold, we refuse to accept either of them as true!”",Muhammad Asad
3301,28,49,"Say: ""Produce, then, [another] revelation from God which would offer better guidance than either of these two [and] I shall follow it, if you speak the truth!""",Muhammad Asad
3302,28,50,"And since they cannot respond to this thy challenge, know that they are following only their own likes and dislikes: and who could be more astray than he who follows [but] his own likes and dislikes without any guidance from God? Verily, God does not grace with His guidance peo­ple who are given to evildoing!",Muhammad Asad
3303,28,51,"NOW, INDEED, We have caused this word [of Ours] to reach mankind step by step, so that they might [learn to] keep it in mind.",Muhammad Asad
3304,28,52,As for those unto whom We have vouchsafed revelation aforetime - they [are bound to] believe in this one [as well];,Muhammad Asad
3305,28,53,"and whenever it is [clearly] conveyed unto them, they [are bound to] profess, ""We have come to believe in it, for, behold, it is the truth from our Sustainer - and, verily, even before this have we surrendered ourselves unto Him!""",Muhammad Asad
3306,28,54,"These it is that shall receive a twofold reward for having been patient in adversity, and having repelled evil with good, and having spent on others out of what We provided for them as sus­tenance,",Muhammad Asad
3307,28,55,"and, whenever they heard frivolous talk, having turned away from it and said: ""Unto us shall be accounted Our deeds, and unto you, your deeds. Peace be upon you - [but] we do not seek out such as are ignorant [of the meaning of right and wrong].""",Muhammad Asad
3308,28,56,"VERILY, thou canst not guide aright everyone whom thou lovest: but it is God who guides him that wills [to be guided]; and He is fully aware of all who would let themselves be guided.",Muhammad Asad
3309,28,57,"Now some say, ""If we were to follow the guidance to which thou invitest us, we would be torn away from our very soil!"" Why - have We not established for them a sanc­tuary secure, to which, as a provision from Us, shall be gathered the fruits of all (good) things? But most of them are unaware [of this truth].",Muhammad Asad
3310,28,58,"And how many a community that [once] exult­ed in its wanton wealth and ease of life have We destroyed, so that those dwelling-places of theirs – all but a few - have never been dwelt-in after them: for it is indeed We alone who shall remain when all else will have passed away!",Muhammad Asad
3311,28,59,"Yet, withal, thy Sustainer would never destroy a community without having [first] raised in its midst an apostle who would convey unto them Our mes­sages; and never would We destroy a community unless its people are wont to do wrong [to one another].",Muhammad Asad
3312,28,60,"And [remember:] whatever you are given [now] is but for the [passing] enjoyment of life in this world, and for its embellishment - whereas that which is with God is [so much] better and more enduring. Will you not, then, use your reason?",Muhammad Asad
3313,28,61,"Is, then, he to whom We have given that goodly promise which he shall see fulfilled [on his resurrection] comparable to one on whom We have bestowed [all] the enjoyments of this worldly life but who, on Resurrection Day, will find himself among those that shall be arraigned [before Us]?",Muhammad Asad
3314,28,62,"For, on that Day He will call unto them, and will ask: ""Where, now, are those [beings or powers] whom you imagined to have a share in My divinity?""",Muhammad Asad
3315,28,63,"[whereupon] they against whom the word [of truth] shall thus stand revealed will exclaim: O our Sustainer! Those whom we caused to err so grievously, we but caused to err as we our­selves had been erring. We [now] disavow them before Thee: it was not us that they worshipped!""",Muhammad Asad
3316,28,64,"And [they] will be told: ""Call [now] unto those [beings or powers] to whom you were wont to ascribe a share in God’s divinity!"" and they will call unto them [for help], but those [fake objects of worship] will not respond to them: whereupon they will see the suffering [that awaits them - the suffering which could have been avoided] if only they had allowed them­selves to be guided!",Muhammad Asad
3317,28,65,"And on that Day He will call unto them, and will ask: ""How did you respond to My message­ bearers?""",Muhammad Asad
3318,28,66,"but all arguments and excuses will by then have been erased from their minds, and they will not [be able to] obtain any [helpful] answer from one another.",Muhammad Asad
3319,28,67,But as against this - anyone who repents and attains to faith and does righteous deeds may well [hope to] find himself among those who achieve a happy state [in the life to come].,Muhammad Asad
3320,28,68,"AND [thus it is:] thy Sustainer creates whatever He wills; and He chooses [for mankind] whatever is best for them. Limitless is God in His glory, and sub­limely exalted above anything to which they may ascribe a share in His divinity!",Muhammad Asad
3321,28,69,And thy Sustainer knows all that their hearts conceal as well as all that they bring into the open:,Muhammad Asad
3322,28,70,"for He is God, save whom there is no deity. Unto Him all praise is due, at the beginning and at the end [of time]; and with Him rests all judgment; and unto Him shall you all be brought back.",Muhammad Asad
3323,28,71,"Say: ""Have you ever considered [this]: If God had willed that there should always be night about you, without break, until the Day of Resurrection - is there any deity other than God that could bring you light? Will you not, then, listen [to the truth]?""",Muhammad Asad
3324,28,72,"Say: ""Have you ever considered [this]: If God had willed that there should always be daylight about you, without break, until the Day of Resurrection - is there any deity other than God that could bring you [the darkness of] night, wherein you might rest? Will you not, then, see [the truth]?""",Muhammad Asad
3325,28,73,"For it is out of His grace that He has made for you the night and the day, so that you might rest therein as well as seek to obtain [what you need] of His bounty: and [He gave you all this] so that you might have cause to be grateful.",Muhammad Asad
3326,28,74,"AND ON THAT DAY He will call unto those [that shall have been arraigned before His judgment seat], and will ask: ""Where, now, are those [beings or powers] whom you imagined to have a share in My divinity?""",Muhammad Asad
3327,28,75,"And [they will remain silent: for by then] We will have called forth witnesses from within every community, and will have said [unto the sinners]: ""Produce an evidence for what you have been claim­ing!"" And so they will come to understand that all truth is God’s [alone]; and all their false imagery will have forsaken them.",Muhammad Asad
3328,28,76,"[NOW, ] BEHOLD, Qarun was one of the people of Moses; but he arrogantly exalted himself above them - simply because We had granted him such riches that his treasure-chests alone would surely have been too heavy a burden for a troop of ten men or even more. When [they perceived his arrogance,] his people said unto him: ""Exult not [in thy wealth], for, verily, God does not love those who exult [in things vain]!",Muhammad Asad
3329,28,77,"Seek instead, by means of what God has granted thee, [the good of] the life to come, without forget­ting, withal, thine own [rightful] share in this world; and do good [unto others] as God has done good unto thee; and seek not to spread corruption on earth: for, verily, God does not love the spreaders of corruption!""",Muhammad Asad
3330,28,78,"Answered he: ""This [wealth] has been given to me only by virtue of the knowledge that is in me!"" Did he not know that God had destroyed [the arrogant of] many a generation that preceded him - people who were greater than he in power, and richer in what they had amassed? But such as are lost in sin may not be asked about, their sins.",Muhammad Asad
3331,28,79,"And so he went forth before his people in all his pomp; [and] those who cared only for the life of this world would say, ""Oh, if we but had the like of what Qarun has been given! Verily, with tremendous good fortune is he endowed!""",Muhammad Asad
3332,28,80,"But those who had been granted true knowl­edge said: ""Woe unto you! Merit in the sight of God is by far the best for any who attains to faith and does what is right: but none save the patient in adversity can ever achieve this [blessing]. """,Muhammad Asad
3333,28,81,"And thereupon We caused the earth to swallow him and his dwelling; and he had none and nothing to succour him against God, nor was he of those who could succour themselves.",Muhammad Asad
3334,28,82,"And on the morrow, those who but yesterday had longed to be in his place exclaimed: ""Alas [for our not having been aware] that it is indeed God [alone] who grants abundant sustenance, or gives it in scant measure, unto whichever He wills of His crea­tures!

In pain did his mother bear him, and in pain did she give him birth; and her bearing him and his utter dependence on her took thirty months. and so, when he attains to full maturity and reaches forty years, he [that is righteous] prays: ""O my Sustainer!

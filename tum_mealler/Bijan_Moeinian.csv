27,2,20,"The lightening makes them almost blind but provides them with a few second of insight so that they take a few steps forward.

33,2,26,"God is definitely not ashamed to refer to a tiny mosquito—or a bigger creature of his own—as an example to make a point. The believers get the message from the example; the unbelievers (on the other hand) will say: ""What does God mean by these stupid examples?""

57,2,50,And remember that we saved you by opening the (red) sea and let you pass safely through it while we drowned Pharaoh’s army [who were charging after you] before your very own eyes.,Bijan Moeinian
58,2,51,Also remember the shameful incidence of the time that you took advantage of days’ absence of Moses [while Torah was being revealed to him in Mat. Sinai] and started to worship the statue of a cow as your creator! How unjust of you.,Bijan Moeinian
59,2,52,In spite of committing such a shameful sin I [God] forgave you so that you may become thankful.,Bijan Moeinian
60,2,53,Also remember My favor to you as I gave Moses Scripture and the Criterion [to distinguish between right and wrong] so that you may be guided [to the right path].,Bijan Moeinian
61,2,54,"Also remember that when Moses [returned from Mt. Sinai] said to his people: ""O my people, you have betrayed your souls by worshiping the statue of a cow.

67,2,60,"I (God) would like to remind you of the occasion when Moses prayed for water for his (thirsty) people. I answered his prayer saying: ""Strike the rock with your staff.""

Moses said: “Do you wish to substitute the worse for the best? Then follow the order of God and go conquer the town [Jerusalem] wherein God will give you whatever you want.

74,2,67,"[In another incident, ] Moses asked his people to [follow the order of God and to] sacrifice a cow [to put its flesh upon a slaughtered man to bring him to life so that he introduce his killer].

75,2,68,"They [jokingly] said: ""Ask <u>your</u> Lord what kind of cow it should be. "" Moses responded: “God says that a middle aged cow is good enough. Now that you have your response, follow the Lord’s order.”",Bijan Moeinian

77,2,70,"They [continued their jokes and] said: ""Ask <u>your</u> Lord to be more specific as there are so many cows with these characteristics! then <u>God willing</u>, we will find it. """,Bijan Moeinian
78,2,71,"Moses said: ""God says that this cow has never been used for plowing the land or watering the crops; an absolutely healthy cow.

79,2,72,Remember when you killed a person and then started to accuse each other. It was the will of God to reveal what you were trying to hide.,Bijan Moeinian
80,2,73,I ordered to strike [the victim’s corps] with the flesh of the sacrificed cow. Thus God performed another miracle by bringing a dead person to life so that you may realize [His power and that the resurrection is a fact.],Bijan Moeinian
81,2,74,"In spite of seeing all these miracles [with your own eyes], your heart became as hard as a rock. Your heart became even harder than a rock; after all, there are rocks that are pierced by water and become the source of a spring, being split so that a river pass through and even melt down when they feel the presence of the Lord. Know that [such awesome] God is not unaware of what you are doing.",Bijan Moeinian
82,2,75,"How do you expect these people to join you in belief? These are the same people who listened to the revelations of God, got the message and then, some of them, knowingly altered the words of God [to fit their purposes. ]",Bijan Moeinian
83,2,76,"When they (Jews) meet with the believers they say: ""We believe [in what you believe. ]"" When they get together in private, they say: “Do you not have any sense when you reveal to them what Got has revealed to us?

84,2,77,Do they not realize that God is fully aware of what they hide and what they reveal?,Bijan Moeinian

87,2,80,"They say: ""If the Fire of Hell has to touch us, it will be for a short period of time!"" Ask them: “Has God promised this to you? God never breaks His promise. ” Know that their sayings are baseless.",Bijan Moeinian

92,2,85,"Now here you are: killing each other, driving your own brothers out of their homes and gang up against each other. Even if the other side surrenders, you demand ransom for them in spite of the fact that the aggression against them was wrong at first place.

God is not unaware of what you do.",Bijan Moeinian
93,2,86,These are the people who have sold their [everlasting] Hereafter for [a small price of a few day of] this world. I will certainly not reduce their sentence and they will not find anyone to help them.,Bijan Moeinian
94,2,87,"I gave the Scriptures to Moses and send many prophets after him. I strengthened [the position of] Jesus, son of Mary [the last prophet sent to the Jews] by many miracles and supported him with the Holy Spirit.

Yet when it was sent to them, they recognized it and chose to disbelieve in it! The disbelievers are cursed by God.",Bijan Moeinian
97,2,90,What a shame when someone decides to sell his own soul by choosing to disbelieve in the guidance sent by God; and what for? That God has [not revealed it to whom they wished and that He has] revealed it to the one that He has chosen out of His Grace! In this way they have earned curse upon curse and there is an awful punishment in reserve for the disbelievers.,Bijan Moeinian
98,2,91,"When they are told: ""Believe in what God has sent to you, "" they reply: “We [choose to] believe only in what is revealed to us (the prophets of our own race) and deny any [additional] revelations. ” This in spite of the fact that it is the truth; confirming what is with them.

99,2,92,Moses came with such undeniable miracles (such as splitting the sea that you witnessed yourselves); then you chose to worship a cow! How unjust of you.,Bijan Moeinian
100,2,93,"I took a solemn pledge from you while raising the Mount Sinai over your heads: ""Follow my revelations to the point and be obedient. "" They promised to believe but they rebelled.
